## Example of Paired Data: Pre- and Post-test Scores

In education, it is very common for researchers to conduct studies in which they administer a pre-test, provide some instruction, and then give a post-test.  The difference between the post- and pre-test scores is a measure of the student's progress.  In this case, it would not make much sense to only look at the mean score on the pre-test and compare it to the mean score on the post-test.

This is called a **matched-pairs** design or we say we have **dependent samples**.  Matched-pairs (or **paired-data**) designs typically involve only one population, and a pair of observations is drawn on the individuals selected for the sample. In the context of the educational study, the two observations are student's scores on (1) the pre-test and (2) the post-test. If a student is selected to participate in the pre-test (i.e., they are selected to be part of group 1), they are automatically selected to participate in the post-test (i.e., they are chosen to be in group 2 automatically.)

There is a lot of merit in subtracting the individual scores and looking at the mean *gain*.
The researchers are not really interested in the students knowledge before the instruction.  This is used as a baseline to measure how much was gained during the instruction.  There is great value in looking at the difference.  This removes the effect of the individual students' ability, and it measures their learning during the unit.

To analyze the data, the researchers first find the difference in the post- and pre-test scores.  At that point, the data have been reduced to a list of numbers (representing the increase in scores).  Now, the researchers can conduct inference on the mean of these values.  In other words, they can do a hypothesis test for the mean of the difference in the post- and pre-test scores.  

A hypothesis test for two means with paired data (dependent samples) is conducted in the same way as a hypothesis test for a single mean with $\sigma$ unknown.  The only exception is that the pairs of data must be subtracted before you start any computations. From a practical perspective, after you subtract, then you apply the one-sample procedures you have already learned.  So, there is nothing new that you need to learn to compute a confidence interval for two means with paired data; just that we will be using a different sheet in the Math221 Statistics Toolbox that automatically calculates the differences.

We will first explore an application of pre- and post-testing in a weight loss study.

### Mahon's Weight Loss Study

**Background**

Annie Mahon and other researchers in Wayne Campbell's nutrition lab studied the weight loss of $n=27$ middle aged women who consumed a prescribed low-calorie diet. <!--<cite>Mahon07</cite>-->  The women's weights were recorded (in kilograms) at the beginning of the study and after the nine-week diet period. The data are given in the file [Mahon.xlsx](./Data/Mahon.xlsx).  An excerpt of the data is given below.

Notice the structure of the data.  The weight of each subject was measured before the study and at the conclusion of the study.  Each person provided a pre-study weight and a post-study weight.  Stated differently, the pre-study weights and the post-study weights are paired.  For each row of data, both of these numbers came from the same person.  When we collect two observations of the same measurement on each subject, we call it **paired data**.  Sometimes paired data are called **dependent samples**.  

<div class="QuestionsHeading">Answer the following question:</div>
<div class="Questions">
1. The researchers measured the initial weights of the women prior to the study, even though they were not particularly interested in this value.  What was the purpose of measuring the pre-study weights?

<div id="Q1" style="display:none;">

* The goal of the study is to determine how much the women's weight change as as result of the study.  The researchers must measure the women's weights at the beginning of the study, so they can subtract the initial (pre-study) weight of each woman from her final (post-study) weight.

<br>

**Computing New Variables in Excel**

The researchers are not interested in the weights of the women, they are more interested in the *change* in the women's weights.  This will give them a measure of the effectiveness of the low-calorie diet. In other words, they are interested in the difference of the weights after the study compared with before:
$$\text{Difference} = \text{Post} - \text{Pre}$$

We can calculate the difference for each woman in the study:

<div class="Summary">
Fortunately, the "Paired Data t-test" tab in the [Math 221 Statistics Toolbox](./Data/Math221StatisticsToolbox.xltx) will automatically compute the differences when you paste in the data. **The Toolbox always takes the data in column A - data in column B.** Because we want to take Post - Pre, you will need to swap the order of the columns when pasting the data into the Math221 Statistics Toolbox. Follow this process:

* Copy the "Pre" column and paste it into column B, labeled "Data2" of the Toolbox.
* Copy the "Post" column and paste it into column A, labeled "Data1" of the Toolbox.
* Notice in column C the differences are automatically calculated.
* A excerpt of how the data looks in the Math221 Statistics Toolbox is shown below:

* The mean weight change experienced by the women in the study was $-6.80$ kg. It can be tricky to know if this means they gained or lost weight. Remember, we calculated Post-Pre. A negative difference indicates the Pre weight was higher than the Post weight. In other words, there was a mean weight loss of $6.80$ kg.

**Relationship to a One Sample t-test**

After you have subtracted the pre-study weights from the post-study weights, you are left with a column of differences.  We will denote the pre-study weights by $x_1$ and the post-study weights by $x_2$.  Then, the differences can be denoted as $d = x_2 - x_1$.  The difference, $d$, is defined as the change in the volunteer's weight during the study.  

After computing the differences, we do not use the data for the individual groups at all. The researchers are not interested in the values of the women's weights at the beginning of the study or at the end of the study.  They are mostly interested in the difference in the weights after the participants complete the study.

After we subtract, we can conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean of the differences is less than zero.  We use the symbol $\mu_d$ to represent the true mean difference in the weights of the women who follow the diet prescribed in this study. The null hypotheses is that the true mean difference is zero  ($\mu_d = 0$).  The alternative hypothesis is that there is a decrease in the weights, in other words, that the true mean difference is less than zero ($\mu_d < 0$).

Notice that this is essentially a one-sample t-test where the data are the differences in the women's weights.  We have one column of data, the differences.  We are testing whether the true mean difference is less than zero.  After subtracting, a test for a difference of two means with paired data is just like a test for one mean with $\sigma$ unknown.

In the hypothesis test, we will refer to the variable representing the differences as $d$. We will use this notation throughout the hypothesis test. For example, the true population mean will be labeled $\mu_d$ and the sample mean will be labeled $\bar d$.  The sample standard deviation of the differences is denoted $s_d$.

**Hypothesis Test for Mahon's Weight Loss Data**


<img src="./Images/Step1.png">

**Summarize the relevant background information**

Twenty-seven women participated in a nine week weight loss study.  During the study period, the participants were provided a reduced calorie diet.  Their weights were recorded at the beginning of the study and nine weeks later.  The difference of the weights is defined as the post-study weights minus the pre-study weights.  The researchers expected that the mean difference in the weights would be negative--in other words, that the women would tend to lose weight.

**State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance**

$$
\begin{align}
H_0: &~~ \mu_d=0 \\
H_a: &~~ \mu_d < 0
\end{align}
$$

We will use the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance.


<img src="./Images/Step2.png">

**Describe the data collection procedures**

The women's weights were recorded at the beginning of the study.  The women were provided a reduced calorie diet for nine weeks.  Then, their weights were measured again at the end of the study.  A calibrated scale was used to provide an accurate weight.


<img src="./Images/Step3.png">

**Give the relevant summary statistics**

Here is the Excel output:

<img src="./Images/Mahon_Paired_t-test_Excel_Toolbox.PNG">

From the Excel output illustrated above, we can see a histogram of the data and get the following numerical summaries:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar d &= -6.80 \\
s_d &= 3.17 \\
n &= 27
\end{align}
$$

The mean and standard deviation are rounded to one decimal place more than the original data.



<img src="./Images/Step4.png">

**Verify the requirements have been met**

Like the one-sample t-test, this procedure is robust, meaning that it is not very sensitive to the requirements.  If they are violated, it will probably still give reasonably good results.  

The requirements for this procedure are the same as the requirements for a one-sample t-test:

- the data represent a simple random sample from the population
- the mean of the differences follows a normal distribution

The subjects were recruited via advertisements for a research study.  The participants volunteered to participate.  It is not a simple random sample of all middle-aged women, but there is nothing about the selection of the sample that would invalidate the results.  

From a practical perspective, it is impossible to get a simple random sample of people in the general population.  When research trials are conducted, people must volunteer to participate.  This can lead to a selection bias, but it is usually negligible.

The requirement of normality is satisfied for Mahon's data. Though the sample size (n=27) is not quite up to 30, it is still fairly large. Furthermore, the histogram of differences indicates very little skew, so $\bar d$ will be approximately normal.  

<center>
<img src="./Images/Mahon-Differences-Histogram.PNG">
</center>

Even with a sample size less than 30, we can still conduct this test.

**Give the test statistic and its value**

The test statistic for a test involving paired data when $\sigma$ is unknown is a $t$.  For this situation, the value is:
$$t= \frac{-6.8 - 0}{3.17/\sqrt{27}} =-11.145$$
See that this calculation matches the test statistic given in the Excel output. The degrees of freedom and p-value can also be found in the Excel output.

**State the degrees of freedom**

$$df = 26$$

**Mark the test statistic and $P$-value on a graph of the sampling distribution**

The test statistic and p-value can be found in the Excel output. The following calculations show conceptually how the p-value is calculated:

The test statistic, $t$, is labeled on the horizontal axis.  The $P$-value is the area to the left of $t$ under the curve.  This area is so small, it is hiding out on the edges (not actuall visible) on this plot.  

<img src="./Images/Mahon-Applet.png">

It is important to note that only the left tail is shaded, even though we cannot see it in this illustration.

**Find the $P$-value and compare it to the level of significance**

$$
P\text{-value} = 1.06 \times 10^{-11} < 0.05 = \alpha
$$

**State your decision**

Since the $P$-value is less than the level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.


<img src="./Images/Step5.png">

**Present your conclusion in an English sentence, relating the result to the context of the problem**

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the reduced calorie diet used in this study results in weight loss for middle-aged women.

### Nosocomial Infections

<span id='17:IntroToNosocomialInfections'></span>

<img src="./Images/Step1.png">

**Summarize the relevant background information**

Matched-pairs designs are not just used in pre- and post-test situations.  They are often used in situations where it is not possible to randomly assign subjects to groups (for example, by a coin toss.)  Nosocomial (pronounced: NO-suh-KOH-MEE-uhl) infections are infections that occur in hospitals, but are not a result of the original condition. An example of a nosocomial infection is when a heart attack patient develops a staph infection at the site of an IV injection.  The infection was not caused by the heart attack, but it was acquired in the hospital.  Nosocomial infections are very dangerous and may result in longer recovery times or increased death rates.

<img src="./Images/Pneumonia-CDC-5803.png">

Health care providers suspect that nosocomial infections increase the amount of time required to recover from an illness or injury. In controlled experiments, subjects (e.g., patients) are randomly assigned to treatments.  However, it is not ethical to give patients a nosocomial infection in order to determine if it increases the duration of their hospital stay!  At best, we can collect information on the duration of hospital stays for patients who acquire nosocomial infections and compare them to the duration of the stays for patients who do not.

There are many factors that affect the amount of time that a patient will need to stay in the hospital, including: nature of illness, types of procedures conducted, overall health, gender, age, etc.  How can health care practitioners assess the effect of a nosocomial infection in the presence of so many other variables?  

One way is to match a patient who develops a nosocomial infection with another one who has similar characteristics (illness, procedures, health, gender, age group, etc.) but does not develop a nosocomial infection.  Now, the patients are matched into pairs with similar characteristics, where the principle difference between the members of each pair is whether or not they acquired a nosocomial infection.

By pairing the patients according to specific characteristics, the researchers can now subtract to observe a difference in their recovery times.  In this way, it is possible to assess if nosocomial infections increase the mean duration of a hospital stay.  Some researchers conducted such a study  in which 52 pairs of patients were matched based on clinical characteristics.  A patient with a nosocomial infection was matched as closely as possible to a similar case where there was no nosocomial infection. Patients who died were excluded from the study <!--<cite>Vegas93</cite>-->.  The lengths of the hospital stays (in days) for these patients are given in the file [NosocomialInfections.xlsx](./Data/NosocomialInfections.xlsx).

The difference, $d$, is defined as the duration of the hospital stay of the individual in the pair with the nosocomial infection minus the duration of the stay for the individual who did not get a nosocomial infection:
$$
Difference=Infected - NotInfected
$$
After computing the differences, we do not use the data for the individual groups at all.  In fact, after we subtract, the hypothesis test is conducted (essentially) like a one-sample test for a single mean with $\sigma$ unknown.

**Summarize the relevant background information**

Obesity is a growing problem worldwide.  Many scientists are seeking creative solutions to trim down this epidemic.  Reduced energy expenditure is a potential cause of obesity.

Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) is defined as the amount of energy a person would use if resting for 24 hours.  In essence, this is the amount of energy that a person's body will consume if they do not do any physical activity.  REE is measured in terms of kilo-Joules per day (kJ/d).

REE accounts for approximately 70 to 80% of all energy that a person will expend in a day. <!--<cite>Carlsson05</cite>-->  If researchers can find simple, enjoyable activities that will increase REE, it may be possible to minimize the spread of obesity around the world.

Ebba Carlsson and other researchers in Sweden investigated whether listening to stressful classical music increases a person's REE. <!--<cite>Carlsson05</cite>-->  Each subject's REE was measuring during silence and again while listening to stressful classical music.  Data representing their results are given in the file [REE-ClassicalMusic](./Data/REE-ClassicalMusic.xlsx).  

Notice that this is not a pre- and post-test, but it is still a test involving paired data.  Two REE measurements were made for each subject:  (1) in silence ($REE_1$) and (2) while listening to stressful classical music ($REE_2$).

**State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance**

Since we are testing for an increase in the mean REE, we let $d = REE_2 - REE_1$. Our alternative hypothesis will be that $\mu_d > 0$.  The null and alternative hypotheses are:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0: &~~ \mu_d = 0 \\
H_a: &~~ \mu_d > 0
\end{align}
$$

Note that the data set has the columns listed with $d = REE_1$ in the first column and $d = REE_2$ in the second column. You will need to switch the order of the columns when pasting them into the Excel Toolbox.

We will use the $\alpha = 0.1$ level of significance.

**Describe the data collection procedures**

The REE was measured by a technique called "indirect calorimetry" using a Deltatrac II Metabolic Monitor. <!--<cite>Carlsson05</cite>-->  The REE was measured twice for each person: while the person was (1) resting in silence or (2) resting while listening to stressful classical music.  These trials were conducted in random order.  Some of the subjects had the "silence" treatment first, and others had the "stressful" treatment first.

#### Cost of Airline Tickets

<img src="./Images/Step1.png">

**Summarize the relevant background information**

Pressures of supply and demand act directly on the prices for an airline ticket.  As the seats available on the plane begin to fill, airlines raise the price.  If seats on a flight do not sell well, an airline may discount the tickets or even cancel the flight.  Business travelers frequently demand travel booked on short notice.  They must pay the current price.  Typically, tourists book their flights well in advance, hoping to buy tickets before the price rises.  We will consider the cost of a one-way ticket from London's Heathrow Airport to a variety of destinations in Europe.

Allie Henrich, a BYU-Idaho student, compared the lowest published ticket prices of one-way flights from Heathrow to various destinations in Europe.  Using Travelocity.com, she recorded the lowest published fares for nonstop midweek flights booked either 14 days in advance or 90 days in advance.  The prices (in US dollars) are given in the file [DirectFlightCosts.xlsx](./Data/DirectFlightCosts.xlsx).  Notice that for some destinations, flights were not available.

The data are paired, because we are measuring the costs twice for each city.  The 14-day ticket price is paired with the 90-day price for each city.

We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a difference in the cost of the nonstop flights when tickets are purchased 14 days in advance compared to 90 days in advance. We will use the 0.01 level of significance.

## Confidence Intervals

We can compute a confidence interval for the true mean of the differences for paired data.  After the differences between two paired data sets have been calculated, we can create a confidence interval for the true mean of the differences.  To do this, we follow the instructions for creating a confidence interval for a one mean with $\sigma$ unknown, but we use the column of differences as the data set.

<div class="SoftwareHeading">Excel Instructions</div>
<div class="Summary">
**To calculate confidence intervals for the true mean of the difference in Excel, do the following**:

* Open the file [Math 221 Statistics Toolbox](./Data/Math221StatisticsToolbox.xltx)
* Click on the tab labeled "Paired Data t-test"
* Enter the columns of paired data into column A and B
* Set the desired confidence level.
<br>

</div>
<br>

The requirements for creating a confidence interval for the difference of means are the same as the requirements for the hypothesis test.  We assume:

* A simple random sample was drawn from the population
* The mean of the differences is normally distributed

### Mountain Pine Beetle Attacks

<img src="./Images/Step1.png">

**Summarize the relevant background information**

Mountain pine beetles are small insects that bore into the bark of trees. The female beetles that first infest the tree emit pheromones to attract other beetles. In response to the pheromones, many beetles bore into the tree and ultimately kill it. The insects can destroy large tree stands within one year.

Lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* Dougl.ex Loud.) are particularly susceptible to mountain pine beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae* Hopkins) outbreaks.  The image above shows the destruction that can be caused by these insects. The large brown patches are pines that have been killed by the beetles.

In a study conducted in the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado, researchers from the USDA Forest Service studied the effect of pine beetle outbreaks on the average number of trees in an area. <!--<cite>Klutsch09</cite>-->  The researchers counted the number of established trees per hectare before a pine beetle outbreak and seven years after an outbreak.

* Answers will vary regarding the description of the density.  Here is one possible response.
* There is roughly one tree every $\frac{100 \times 100}{1028.41} = 9.7$ square meters.  In other words, on average, each tree would have a space of about $\sqrt{9.7} = 3.1$ meters long and 3.1 meters wide in which to grow.

### Sleep Inducing Drugs

<img src="./Images/Step1.png">

**Summarize the relevant background information**

In William Sealy Gosset's landmark paper on the $t$-distribution, he cites data on a sleep-inducing drug. In a paper published in 1905, Arthur R. Cushny and A. Roy Peebles reported the effect of Laevorotatory Hyoscyamine Hydrobromate (L-Hyoscyamine) on the length of time that people sleep before waking. <!-- cite{Cushny05} -->  The primary research question is: does L-Hyoscyamine impact the mean amount of time that people sleep?  We will compute a 90% confidence for the true mean difference in the times.


<img src="./Images/Step2.png">

**Describe the data collection procedures**

Eleven subjects were included in the study.  At the start of the study, the researchers observed the average length of time that each of the participants slept before waking.  Later, each subject was given 0.6 mg of L-Hyoscyamine and the duration of uninterrupted sleep was again measured.

The difference in the amount of time each person slept was computed by subtracting the amount of time the subjects slept when taking the drug minus the sleep duration with no drug.  The data are summarized in the table below.

Notice that the "control" data for Subject #11 is missing.  It is not possible to compute a difference for this person, so their data will be omitted from our analysis.  For this analysis, we will use the remaining $n=10$ observations.

You may find it easier to copy and paste the data from the following table.  The last row has been omitted.

* a. We assume the subjects represent a random sample from the population.

* b. Remember, just like the hypothesis test, this confidence interval for a mean of differences is robust. That means it is not very sensitive to the requirements. If they are violated, this interval estimate will probably still give reasonably good results. Because the sample size is small, with only 10 values, it is hard to see a shape in a histogram of the data, regardless of the number of bins chosen. However, it is clear that the data is not strongly skewed. We will move forward, assuming the requirement of a normal sampling distribution of $\bar d$ is not violated.

* We are 90% confident that the true mean difference in the amount of time people sleep by taking this drug compared to not taking the drug is between $-0.287$ hours and $1.787$ hours.
* Notice that 0 is in the confidence interval.  This suggests that 0 is a plausible value for the mean difference in the times.  In other words, the drug does not seem to affect the amount of time people sleep.  L-Hyoscyamine is not an effective sleep aid--at least at these dosage levels.

## Summary

<div class="SummaryHeading">Remember...</div>
<div class="Summary">

- The key characteristic of **dependent samples** (or **matched pairs**) is that knowing which subjects will be in group 1 determines which subjects will be in group 2.

- We use slightly different variables when conducting inference using dependent samples:

    Group 1 values: $x_1$&nbsp;&nbsp;Group 2 values: $x_2$&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences: $d$&nbsp;&nbsp;Population mean: $\mu_d$&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample mean: $\bar d$&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample standard deviation: $s_d$

- When conducting hypothesis tests using dependent samples, the null hypothesis is always $\mu_d=0$, indicating that there is no change between the first population and the second population. The alternative hypothesis can be left-tailed ($<$), right-tailed($>$), or two-tailed($\ne$).
