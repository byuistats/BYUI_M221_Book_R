This is not designed to be a comprehensive review.  There may be items on the exam that are not covered in this review.  Similarly, there may be items in this review that are not tested on this exam.  You are strongly encouraged to review the readings, homework exercises, and other activities from Unit 1 as you prepare for the exam.

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 01 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">
- Each lesson follows the same schedule: **Individual and Group Preparation**, **Class Meeting**, and **Homework Assignment and Quiz**. Understanding this layout will help you successfully manage the workload of this class.

- In this class you will use the online textbook that has been written for you by your statistics teachers. All of the assignments and quizzes will be based on the readings, so study it well.

- By doing the work, staying on schedule, and living the Honor Code you *can* succeed in this class!

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 02 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">
- The **Statistical Process** has five steps: **D**esign the study, **C**ollect the data, **D**escribe the data, **M**ake inferences, **T**ake action.

- In a **designed experiment**, researchers control the conditions of the study. In an **observational study**, researchers don't control the conditions but only observe what happens.

- There are many sampling methods used to obtain a **sample** from a **population**:
  + A **simple random sample (SRS)** is a random selection taken from a population
  + A **systematic sample** is every ***k***<sup>th</sup> item in the population, beginning at a random starting point
  + A **cluster sample** is all items in one or more randomly selected clusters, or blocks
  + A **stratified sample** divides data into similar groups and an **SRS** is taken from each group
  + A **convenience sample** is one easily obtained in a less-than-systematic way and should be avoided whenever possible 

- **Quantitative variables** represent things that are numeric in nature, such as the value of a car or the number of students in a classroom. **Categorical variables** represent nonnumerical data that can only be considered as labels, such as colors or brands of shoes.

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 03 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- A **histogram** allows us to visually interpret data. Histograms can be left-skewed, right-skewed, or symmetrical and bell-shaped.

- The **mean**, **median**, and **mode** are measures of the center of a distribution. The mean is the most common measure of center and is computed by adding up the observed data and dividing by the number of observations in the data set.

- The **standard deviation** is a number that describes how spread out the data are. A larger standard deviation means the data are more spread out than data with a smaller standard deviation.

- A **parameter** is a true (but usually unknown) number that describes a population. A **statistic** is an estimate of a parameter obtained from a sample. 

- **Quartiles/percentiles**, **Five-Number Summaries**, and **Boxplots** are tools that help us understand data. The five-number summary of a data set contains the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. A boxplot is a graphical representation of the five-number summary.

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 04 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- The three **rules of probability** are:
1. A probability is a number between 0 and 1. 
$$0 \leq P(X) \leq 1$$

2. If you list all the outcomes of a probability experiment (such as rolling a die) the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is 1. In other words, the sum of the probabilities in any probability is 1. 
$$\sum P(X) = 1$$

3. The probability that an outcome will not occur is 1 minus the probability that it will occur. 
$$P(\text{not}~X) = 1 - P(X)$$
</div>
<br>



<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 05 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- A **normal density curve** is symmetric and bell-shaped. The curve lies above the horizontal axis and the total area under the curve is equal to 1. 

- A **standard normal distribution** has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The **68-95-99.7% rule** states that when data are normally distributed, approximately 68% of the data lie within 1 standard deviation from the mean, approximately 95% of the data lie within 2 standard deviations from the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data lie within 3 standard deviations from the mean. 

- A **z-score** tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a given value is. It is calculated as: $\displaystyle{z = \frac{\text{value}-\text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}} = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}$

- The **probability applet** allows us to use z-scores to calculate proportions, probabilities, and percentiles.

<!-- - A **Q-Q plot** is used to assess whether or not a set of data is normally distributed. -->

<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 06 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- The **distribution of sample means** is a distribution of all possible sample means ($\bar x$) for a particular sample size. It has a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.

- The distribution of sample means is normal when $\bar x$ is normally distributed or when, thanks to the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**, our sample size ($n$) is large.

- The **Law of Large Numbers** states that as the sample size ($n$) gets larger, the sample mean ($\bar x$) will get closer to the population mean ($\mu$).
</div>
<br>



<div class="RecapHeading">Lesson 07 Recap</div>
<div class="Summary">

- When the distribution of sample means is normally distributed, we can use **z-scores** and the **probability applet** to calculate proportions and probabilities. A z-score is calculated as: $\displaystyle{z = \frac{\text{value}-\text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}} = \frac{\bar x-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}}$

- The **$P$-value** is the probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the one you got, assuming $H_0$ is true. A $P$-value is calculated by finding the area under the normal distribution curve that is more extreme (farther away from the mean) than the z-score.
