<div id="welcome-to-the-course" class="section level2">
<h2>Welcome to the Course!</h2>
<p>In this course, you will explore important connections between the academic discipline of Statistics and the world around us. By pondering these ideas, your understanding of statistics will increase, as will your knowledge and testimony of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. In addition, that which you learn in this course will increase your ability to serve others as a disciple of Jesus Christ and help build Zion.</p>
<p>If you have never taken an online class before, you are in for a new and exciting learning experience. This course uses some of the most advanced educational tools. These technologies will help you learn in an effective and efficient way, often allowing you to learn more than you would in a traditional Statistics class—and in less time. Although some of the learning activities will require you to work on your own, you will also be engaged in activities with other students and your instructor. Through your group interactions, you will have many opportunities to teach one another by sharing ideas and solving problems together.</p>
<p>This course has been designed to help you slowly build up a knowledge base of ideas and skills. Not all of these ideas and skills will come easily. It takes a lot of work and practice before some things will even start to make sense, so you should not be surprised to find that it may take you a little time to comprehend these ideas. Just be patient. Once you’re far enough into the course, the ideas will start to come together, and you will see how much progress you have really made. You will understand what this course is all about, and you will be glad you persisted in your efforts to learn.</p>
<p>As you thoughtfully prepare, teach one another, ponder/prove what you have learned, and as you humbly seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Lord will bless you with a greater knowledge of His mercy and love. You will have the opportunity to increase your testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. You will also learn about Statistics, more deeply and permanently than you would have otherwise.</p>

<div id="course-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course covers the following topics as they are applied to Statistics: graphical representations of data, measures of center and spread; elementary probability; sampling distributions; correlation and regression; statistical inference involving means, proportions, and contingency tables.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="course-learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>In this course, we will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Summarize data numerically and graphically using spreadsheets</li>
<li>Make decisions regarding situations with inherent randomness</li>
<li>Apply probability distributions to investigate questions</li>
<li>Employ confidence intervals in various situations</li>
<li>Implement tests of diverse hypotheses</li>
<li>Communicate the results of statistical analyses to relevant audiences</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="how-the-outcomes-will-be-assessed" class="section level3">
<h3>How the Outcomes will Be Assessed</h3>
<p>While you may not be tested on everything you learn in this course, the instructor will be assessing your mastery of the <strong>Course Learning Outcomes</strong>. The general types of assessments used to measure these outcomes may include selected response tests such as multiple-choice, true-false, matching, and fill-in-the-blank questions. You may also be asked to complete essays or other writing assignments. At times, the instructor may assess your performance of a skill, or the instructor may assess products you create using particular skills. In addition, the instructor may engage in personal communication with you to determine how well you understand the course content.</p>

<h3>Keys to Success</h3>
<div id="five-principles-of-the-learning-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Five Principles of the Learning Model</h4>
<p>You will experience much deeper learning if you follow the Five Principles of the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/LearningModel" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise Faith</strong>: Exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a principle of action and power.</li>
<li><strong>Learn by the Holy Ghost</strong>: Understand that true teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li><strong>Lay Hold on the Word of God</strong>: Lay hold of the word of God.</li>
<li><strong>Act for Themselves</strong>: Act for yourself and accept responsibility for learning and teaching.</li>
<li><strong>Love, Serve, and Teach One Another</strong>: Love, serve, and teach other students in your classes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="three-process-steps-of-the-learning-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Three Process Steps of the Learning Model</h4>
<p>You will learn more in less time if you follow the Three Process Steps of the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/LearningModel" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare</strong>: This involves (a) spiritual preparation, (b) individual preparation, and (c) group preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Teach One Another</strong>: You should (a) be on time, (b) pray together, and (c) actively engage with other students.</li>
<li><strong>Ponder/Prove</strong>: You should (a) ponder what you have learned, (b) record your learning, and (c) pursue unanswered questions and discuss what you learn with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel confused or have questions about anything in the lesson, take immediate action (Exercise Faith; Act for Themselves) and talk with your classmates, the teaching assistant, or the instructor (Love, Serve, and Teach One Another).</p>
<p><strong>Teach One Another</strong></p>
<p>At BYU-Idaho, an “A” student will demonstrate “diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students” (BYU-Idaho Catalog). In this class, you will have the opportunity to work with other students.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 84:106 states, “And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.” In the spirit of this revelation, you will have the opportunity to help others in the class when you have developed an understanding of a principle. Likewise, you will be able to receive help from others (peers, tutors, TA, and your instructor) when you are still working to understand concepts.</p>
<p>This course represents a collaborative effort between faculty, TA’s, tutors, students and the Lord. You are encouraged to seek the help from seen and unseen resources as you grapple with the principles of Statistics.</p>
<p>In a spirit of love and service, please reach out to others. You are not graded on a curve. If someone else does well, it does not affect you adversely. Research has shown that students who help other students to understand the material gain a much deeper grasp on the concepts of the course. Please take opportunities to help your peers succeed.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The structure of this course is based on scientific research on student learning and retention. The activities, structure, pace, and repetition are all grounded in modern educational theories and practices. This course has been designed with you, the student, in mind.</p>
<p>This course consists of 24 lessons. They are presented in a topical order in which concepts and skills learned in the earlier lessons provide the requisite knowledge to succeed in later lessons. If the general order of the lessons doesn’t make sense at first, don’t worry. It will all come together in the end, and you’ll see the reasoning behind why the lessons have been presented in this particular order.</p>
<p>Your main goal as a student will be to complete all of the learning activities within each lesson by their due dates every week. These activities follow a consistent weekly schedule, and it will be up to you to make sure that you keep on pace with all your assignments. These weekly activities may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading assigned texts or viewing presentations.</li>
<li>Taking quizzes.</li>
<li>Participating in group discussions and assignments with other class members.</li>
<li>Writing papers and developing presentations.</li>
<li>Participating in meetings with the instructor, teaching assistants, and other students.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these activities, the due dates will fall on the same time each week. This will make it easier for you to plan out your weekly study schedule. However, there may be a need to make adjustments to the schedule from time to time. If in doubt, refer to the due dates your instructor has posted in I-learn.</p>
<p>And now for a word of warning. If you start to fall behind, this course has built-in automatic “early warning signals” that will alert your instructor to possible problems. If your instructor contacts you to check on your progress, it is most likely because you’ve fallen behind in your assignments and triggered an “early warning signal.” If this happens, please work with your instructor. You’ll need to create a study schedule that will catch you up and keep you on pace throughout the semester. This is a rigorous course with a lot of subject matter to cover, and it can be extremely difficult to recover if you fall too far behind in your work. So, please make every effort to study on a regular basis and get your work turned in on time. <br></p>
<div id="lesson-pattern" class="section level3">
<h3>Lesson Pattern</h3>
<p>The lessons in this course have a similar structure and contain similar basic elements. A typical week consists of two lessons.</p>
<p>The learning activities fully integrate the BYU-Idaho Learning model. They contain a mixture of preparation activities, teach-one-another activities, and ponder-and-prove activities. You will need to complete these activities in the order in which they are listed.</p>
<div id="individual-preparation" class="section level4">
<h4>Individual Preparation</h4>
<p>Each lesson begins with a reading assignment. These readings are provided in this e-textbook. Be sure to answer the questions in the textbook, since these are an important part of the learning process. A note page is provided for each reading which you should use to write down the most important concepts from the reading. Taking good notes is an important part of being prepared for future quizzes and exams. The reading assignment must be completed before attending Group Preparation.</p>
</div>
<div id="group-preparation" class="section level4">
<h4>Group Preparation</h4>
<p>Group Preparation is an opportunity to share what you have learned from Individual Preparation with your group and to learn from one another. This will help to solidify the concepts presented in the reading. Group Preparation is held twice a week at the same time of day as your class meeting. The Group Preparation session provides opportunities to work in small groups with specially trained TAs. You may choose to meet with your group via [[#Zoom Video Conferencing | Zoom]] or in person. If you meet in person, one group member will need to be on [[#Zoom Video Conferencing | Zoom]] in order to communicate with the TAs. One member of your group will be chosen to be the Group Leader. He or she will be responsible for reporting group attendance as well as submitting questions from the group to the TAs which will be communicated to the instructor.</p>
<p>Please purchase a headset with a microphone and earphones. You will use these to participate via [[#Zoom Video Conferencing | Zoom]]. Make sure you arrive a little early to each session in order to have time to join the meeting and set up your microphone and headphones.</p>
<p>As a group you will complete the practice problems provided in Part 2 of your Reading Notes and will submit your answers to the TAs for feedback. When you have successfully completed the practice problems and received feedback you may begin the Group Quiz. While you are encouraged to work together on this quiz, each member of the group must submit his or her own answers in order to receive credit. Attendance to Group Preparation is a requirement and will be reported to the TAs via the Group Leader. No credit will be given for the group assignment or quiz if you do not attend.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-meeting" class="section level4">
<h4>Class Meeting</h4>
<p>The day after Group Preparation, we will meet as a class. During the Class Meeting, you will work with students in your group to apply the principles of that lesson. Your instructor will address any questions that were communicated by the TAs from Group Preparation.</p>
</div>
<div id="homework" class="section level4">
<h4>Homework</h4>
<p>The homework is divided into two parts: the homework assignment and the homework quiz. Complete the homework assignment before beginning the quiz. This assignment comes with an answer key so that you may check your work. You are encouraged to collaborate with other students on the homework assignment, but it is important to the learning process that you do your own work. Before working with someone else on the assignment, you should attempt each problem on your own. After you have completed the homework assignment you may begin the homework quiz. You may use your notes, but you should complete the homework quiz without help from others. The quiz will have questions similar to the ones found in the homework assignment, so it is important that you understand well how to work through the problems in the homework assignment before beginning the quiz.</p>
</div>

<div id="benefits-of-lesson-schedule" class="section level3">
<h3>Benefits of Lesson Schedule</h3>
<p>You can use the calendar feature in I-learn to see the schedule of lessons. A typical week consists of two lessons.</p>
<p>There are several benefits of this consistent lesson structure. First, it helps you establish a regular schedule for studying and participating in class activities. Second, it helps you learn more in less time. By the third or fourth lesson, you will find that it takes you less time to navigate through the course and complete certain activities and you will know what you need to do to succeed. Third, it gives you an opportunity to develop discipleship and leadership by teaching other students on a regular basis through class meetings and small group activities. Finally, the lesson structure makes it easier for you to give feedback to the instructor so that future lessons may be improved. This is an important part of the “teach one another” concept in the BYU-Idaho learning model. By giving feedback on what does and does not work for you in each lesson, you help other BYU-Idaho students get more out of the class. So, as you go through each lesson, feel free to make notes about the things that worked well for you, as well as the things that could be improved. Include these ideas in the Lesson Evaluation Survey. Your efforts to provide feedback to the instructor will not only help improve the course, but by taking the time to think about these things, you will become a better teacher yourself.</p>

<div id="plan-to-succeed" class="section level2">
<h2>Plan to Succeed</h2>
<!--**How to Succeed in This Course**-->
<p>There are three basic things you must do to succeed in this course.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do the work.</li>
<li>Stay on schedule.</li>
<li>Follow the Honor Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do these three things, you will not only get a passing grade for the course, but you will have an excellent educational experience. Here’s why.</p>
<div id="do-the-work" class="section level4">
<h4>Do the Work</h4>
<p>This is a rigorous course. To get a passing grade, you will have to put forth a good deal of effort to complete all of the assignments. When you see a time estimate next to a learning activity, that is the approximate amount of time it will take IF you are focused on the assignment and IF you are not allowing yourself to be distracted by other things. You will have a very difficult time completing these assignments if you do them at the same time you watch TV, cook food, talk with your roommates or family members, and send text messages to your friends every three minutes. You must set aside sufficient time to do the work throughout the week (you can’t do it all in one night!). And you must find a place to do the work where you will not be distracted by anything (you can’t get it done with a cell phone call interrupting you every few minutes!). Then you must commit to focus your attention on the work and do your very best to complete it in the amount of time you have scheduled. If you do this, you will learn more in less time, and you will find the work much more pleasurable.</p>
</div>
<div id="stay-on-schedule" class="section level4">
<h4>Stay on Schedule</h4>
<p>Once you have set up a regular study schedule, keep it. One of the biggest problems that students have with their courses is that they procrastinate doing the work. They put it off until they have so much work to do that they cannot figure out a way to get it all done before the due date arrives. In this course, you cannot do this and still expect to receive a passing grade. There are assignments that must be completed by specific days and times every week. If you put off doing the work until just before an assignment is due, you will find it much more difficult to concentrate on getting the work done. To succeed in this class, you will have to follow your regular study schedule every week to ensure that you do your best work and that it gets done on time.</p>
</div>
<div id="follow-the-honor-code" class="section level4">
<h4>Follow the Honor Code</h4>
<p>Although there are several types of group learning activities in every lesson, this course requires a lot of individual study and work. In particular, most assignments involving a study guide and quiz are meant to be learning activities you complete on your own. If you decide to work with others to try find all the quiz answers without having to do all the assigned work, you are not only cheating yourself out of an education, you are cheating your way to a failing grade. There are other assignments throughout the course that will require you to recall information or use skills that you should have developed as you completed the learning activities. If you don’t do the work, and you try to cheat your way to higher quiz grades, you will hinder your ability to complete these other assignments. Most likely, you will fail those assignments. So, do yourself and others a favor–do not cheat on any assignments, no matter how tempting it might be. Instead, renew your commitment to follow the BYU-Idaho Honor Code, double your efforts to do the work, and follow your study schedule.</p>
</div>
<div id="plan-for-success" class="section level4">
<h4>Plan for Success</h4>
<p>Clearly, if you want to succeed in this course, you need to figure out how you will do the work and how you will stay on schedule. Doing this will help you avoid situations in which you might be tempted to violate the Honor Code and cheat. Such situations can arise quicker in the semester than you might think. So, it is important for you to start making a plan for success right away. Take time now to write your own plan for success. This plan should include a weekly study schedule and a general list of things you think you will need to do each week to get the work done. Be prepared to discuss this plan with your study group and with the instructor.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As with all the classes you take at BYU-Idaho, in the end it is up to you to decide what you want to get out of this class. If you choose to approach the things you study in class with an open mind, if you prepare diligently and work hard to complete all the learning activities, and if you humbly seek the Lord’s help to understand the intellectual and spiritual truths discussed in this course, you will have an outstanding educational experience that will be a blessing to you throughout your life.</p>
