<h2>Case Study: Eating Habits of College Students</h2>

</div>
<p><img src="Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p>Chances are that as a college student you have probably thought to yourself, “It takes too much time to prepare healthy food.” In fact, the American College Health Association estimates that only 6% of college students across the U.S. are eating the recommended “five or more servings of fruits and vegetables” daily.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In an effort to better understand the barriers that were keeping college students from eating healthy, a team of researchers from the Department of Psychology at BYU-Idaho undertook a study.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img src="Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>The team of researchers obtained a convenience sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=517\)</span> college students from General Psychology courses over three different semesters. <a href="javascript:showhide('articledetails')"><span style="font-size:8pt;">Click to Show/Hide More Sampling Details</span></a></p>
<div id="articledetails" style="display:none;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">
<p>As reported in their article, “Participation in this study was a required experiential component of the course, but students’ grades were based on participation rather than performance and alternate assignments were available.” Further, use of the data for research purposes was approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
</div>
<p>The survey contained many questions for the students to answer and found some fantastic conclusions about what keeps students from eating healthy. (If you are interested, <a href="https://byuiscroll.org/psychology-students-did-the-research-for-you/">click here</a> to read an news article highlighting their findings.) One important question on the survey asked each student whether or not they (the student) ate fresh fruits and vegetables as part of their daily diet. They were allowed to answer with either of</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, not all students out of the 517 that were surveyed answered the question. We will summarize the results of the answers below as we also present details on how to describe categorical data.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step3.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="numerical-and-graphical-summaries-of-categorical-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Numerical and Graphical Summaries of Categorical Data</h2>
<p>To describe categorical data, we need a different approach than what we used for quantitative data. Instead of discussing means (like <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>) we will work with proportions. A proportion is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the relative size of a part of something to the whole of that thing. In the current eating habits study, the researchers are interested in knowing the proportion of students who experience barriers to healthy eating. This proportion probably isn’t 0 (which would imply no students experience barriers to healthy eating) and probably isn’t 1 (which would imply all students experience barriers to healthy eating) but is likely somewhere in between.</p>
<div class="myemphasis">
<p><strong>Proportions</strong>: A number between 0 and 1 that measures the size of a part to the whole.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample proportion</strong> is a sample statistic. It is written as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>. It is computed by taking the number of “successes” in the data, called <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and dividing by the total number of individuals in the sample, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (the sample size).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Sample Proportion:} \quad \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}
\]</span></p>
<p>The theoretical <strong>true proportion</strong> for a population is written as just <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. It is a population parameter. To compute the <em>true proportion</em> we must know the total size of the population (or total possible outcomes) <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, as well as the number of possible <em>successes</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We rarely know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. But we can usually hypothesize a reasonable value for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> using a null hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 \text{True Proportion:} \quad p = \frac{X}{N} \quad \text{(Usually unknown)}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a quick glance at the data for one of the questions from the eating habits study.</p>

<p>Notice that in this data, some students chose not to answer this question, i.e., “No Answer”. Other students answered “Yes” and other students answered “No”. Our first step to computing the <strong>proportion</strong> of students who answered “Yes” (what we will call successes in this case) is to count up two numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we count how many students said “Yes”. This turns out to give <span class="math inline">\(x = 245\)</span>.</li>
<li>Second, we count how many students answered the question. This gives our sample size as <span class="math inline">\(n = 399\)</span>.</li>
<li>Third, we divide to get</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{245}{399} \approx 0.614
\]</span></p>
<p>This shows that 61.4% of students in our sample claim to regularly eat fresh fruits and vegetables as part of their daily diet. That implies that 38.6% (1 - 0.614 = 0.386) of students in our sample, which is a little more than 1 out of every 3 students, <em>are not</em> regularly eating fresh fruits and vegetables as part of their daily diet.</p>
<div id="r-instructions-for-computing-sample-proportions" class="section level3">
<h3>R-Instructions for Computing Sample Proportions</h3>
<div class="SoftwareHeading">
R Instructions
</div>
<div class="Software">
<p><strong>To compute the sample proportion in R:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>table(...)</code> function to count up how many times certain observations occur in a dataset.</li>
<li>Use the <code>/</code> symbol to divide <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To practice, start by reading in the <a href="./data/EatingHealthy.xlsx">EatingHealthy.xlsx</a> data file into RStudio. (For a reminder on how to read in data, <a href="RHelp.html#reading-in-data.">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Next, note that the “Yes” and “No” answers to the question “Do you regularly eat fresh fruits and vegetables?” is stored in the column of the dataset called <code>Eathealthy</code>. So we use the <code>table(</code> function, followed by the name of the dataset <code>EatingHealthy</code> followed by a <code>$</code> sign, followed by the column name <code>Eathealthy</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Count up the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; answers:
table(EatingHealthy$Eathealthy)</code></pre>
<pre><code>
 NA  No Yes 
118 154 245 </code></pre>
<p>From this we learn that there are 118 people who did not answer this question (the “NA” means the answer is “Not Available”), 154 people answered “No”, and 245 people answered “Yes”. Considering only those that answered this question we have a total of <span class="math inline">\(n=399\)</span> people that answered:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Get the sample size by adding up &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; answers:
154 + 245</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 399</code></pre>
<p>Dividing the number of “Yes” answers (<span class="math inline">\(x=245\)</span>) by the total number of answers (<span class="math inline">\(n=399\)</span>) gives the proportion of students in our sample claiming to eat a healthy diet, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.614\)</span> or 61.4%.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Compute the sample proportion:
245/399</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.6140351</code></pre>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div id="bar-charts" class="section level3">
<h3>Bar Charts</h3>
<p>Bar charts are a powerful way to quickly display categorical data. They provide a bar for each category in the data, and the height of the bar shows the number of observations from the sample that landed in that particular category.</p>
<p>We can represent the various answers of the students concerning whether or not they “regularly eat fresh fruits and vegetables” with a bar chart.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson16_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above chart shows that the 118 students that did not respond to this question represent a substantial portion of the total students surveyed. That could be leading to some bias in the results because we don’t know if the “NA” responses would land in the “Yes” or “No” group. But, if we consider just those that answered the question, it seems that many students (61.4% of those that answered the question) are doing a great job eating fresh fruits and vegetables as part of their diet.</p>

<li>First, read in the data: <a href="./data/EatingHealthy.xlsx">EatingHealthy</a>. (Review of <a href="RHelp.html#reading-in-the-data">reading in data</a>.)</li>
<li>Second, use the <code>table(...)</code> function, the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code>, and a name for the table of counts that you create (like <code>mytable</code>) to save a table of counts.</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left:40px;">
<pre class="r"><code>#Save your table of counts:
mytable &lt;- table(EatingHealthy$Eathealthy)
mytable</code></pre>
<pre><code>
 NA  No Yes 
118 154 245 </code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you might not have kept track of the actual dataset, but you might still know the counts already. In that case, manually type the counts into R using the combine function <code>c(...)</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mytable &lt;- c(`NA` = 118, `No` = 154, `Yes` = 245)</code></pre>
<p>Note how the above code puts a label in front of each number. That will make it so the bar chart prints those labels underneath of each bar. Although it is not required, placing a back-tick on each side of your labels (as shown in the code above) is good practice.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>barplot(...)</code> function on your table of counts to create a bar chart of the values.</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left:40px;">
<pre class="r"><code>#Create a plot of the counts in mytable:
barplot(mytable)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lesson16_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Specify colors for the bar chart using either <code>col="steelblue3"</code> to give all bars the same color, or use <code>col=c("tan3","brown3","steelblue3")</code> to give each bar a different color. Of course, use any color names you like: <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf">R Color Options</a></li>
<li>Specify axes labeling with <code>main="A main title"</code>, <code>xlab="An x-axis label"</code>, and <code>ylab="A y-axis label"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>#Make a fancier graph using the options:
barplot(mytable,
        col=c(&quot;tan3&quot;,&quot;brown3&quot;,&quot;steelblue3&quot;),

<p>Before we move on, it is worth mentioning that bar charts can represent many categories rather than just “Yes” and “No” answers. For example, here is a bar chart showing the student answers to the question asking students about the barriers they faced to eating a healthy diet. (A healthy diet was stated to be a diet that included fresh fruits and vegetables.) Students were allowed to select as many of the following answers as they felt applicable in response to this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is too expensive to purchase fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>It takes too much time to prepare healthy food (e.g., fruits and vegetables).</li>
<li>There are not enough options for healthy eating here.</li>
<li>I am uncomfortable with healthy eating because it is something I am not familiar with.</li>
<li>It is confusing to know what is considered “healthy eating” anymore.</li>
<li>I prefer tasty, quick options such as fast food.</li>
<li>I do not see positive results when I eat healthy (e.g., I am not full, I do not lose weight).</li>
<li>Other, please specify.</li>

<p>To learn how to <em>Make Inference</em> (Step 4 of the Statistical Process) about the true population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we first need to explore the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. You may recall studying the <a href="Lesson06.html#introduction-to-sampling-distributions">sampling distribution of the sample mean</a> in Lesson 6. Using those ideas along with the z-score equation of Lesson 7, we were able to use the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, to make inference about the population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Now we will study how to use the sample proportion, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>, to make inference about the population proportion, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, by studying the sampling distribution of the sample proportion.</p>

</div>
<p>If you were asked the question, “What is the probability of flipping a head with a fair coin?” you would likely correctly answer by stating that there is a 50% chance of getting a head. You know this because there are <span class="math inline">\(N=2\)</span> possibilities (a head on one side and a tail on the other) and only one side, <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span>, can give a head. That gives the true proportion of heads to be <span class="math inline">\(p=X/N=1/2 = 0.5\)</span>. However, if you have ever flipped a coin several times and recorded your results, you would know that you don’t usually get exactly 50% heads.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, we actually flipped a coin <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times and recorded our results. We got <span class="math inline">\(x=12\)</span> heads. That comes out to a sample proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 12/25 = 0.48\)</span>. While not exactly 50%, it is fairly close. We can represent the results in a simple bar chart.</p>

<p>If you just completed the two questions above, you likely got a different answer than what we got for the proportion of heads in your <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> flips. (Although it is somewhat likely, 13.3% chance, that you would have also gotten 12/25 heads.) So why is it that if the true proportion is <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>, we all can get different answers for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> when we each flip a coin <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times? As you likely already know, the reason that answers for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> can vary from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is because the coin flips are random. This is the very idea behind a <em>random sample</em> of data. In fact, this means that we should expect the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> to vary randomly from the true proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> anytime we take a sample of data. The only way to really know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for sure would be to take a census and survey the entire population! That is typically too much work. And fortunately, thanks to statistically theory about the <em>sampling distribution of the sample proportion</em>, we can actually quantify how far away from the true proportion our sample proportion will be, say 95% of the time. Let’s see how this work.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-sampling-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a Sampling Distribution</h3>
<p>A true sampling distribution of a sample proportion is obtained by plotting the results from <em>all possible</em> samples from a population of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. It isn’t reasonable to try to create such a distribution in its entirety, but we can look at a quick example using the data file <a href="./data/CoinTossHeads.xlsx">CoinTossHeads.xlsx</a>. This data file contains data representing a collection of 900 students’ results, where each student tossed a coin <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times and calculated their proportion of heads. These 900 different sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> represent 900 different samples (of <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> coin flips in each sample) from the population of all coin flip possibilities. The goal of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is to consider the set of all possible sample proportions that could be obtained when getting a sample from a population, and where those sample proportions would land, i.e., how they would be distributed.</p>
<p>The following histogram shows the distribution of the sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> for each of the 900 students that participated in the coin flip experiment. It turns out that there were 134 students in the sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=900\)</span> that also flipped 12/25 heads like we did. However, there were also 137 students that flipped 13/25 heads. But notice that very few students (only 5) got as few as 5/25 heads and very few students (only 7) got as many as 19/25 heads. And no one (out of all 900 students that participated) got more than 19 heads (19/25 = 0.76) or fewer than 5 heads (5/25 = 0.2).</p>

<p>We can apply the Central Limit Theorem to a sample proportion (and conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat p\)</span> follows a normal distribution) if both of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(np \ge 10\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(n(1-p) \ge 10\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to check both conditions. If one of them is not satisfied, we cannot conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\widehat p\)</span> follows a normal distribution. Observe that the effect of these two conditions is that if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is very close to 0 or 1, then <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> isn’t close to normal unless <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is very large.</p>

<h2>Probability Calculations for a Sample Proportion</h2>

<div class="message Note">
<strong>Remember:</strong> We can use the Normal Probability Applet to find probabilities associated with any normally distributed random variable with known mean and standard deviation.
</div>
<p><br> <br></p>
<p>If the sample size is sufficiently large, we can use the Normal Probability Applet to make probability calculations for proportions, just as we did for means. First, we need to find the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score. This can be done with the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{\textrm{value} - \textrm{mean}}{\textrm{standard deviation}}
= \frac{\widehat p - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p \cdot (1-p)}{n}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then, we can enter this <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score in the Normal Probability Applet to find the area more extreme than the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score.</p>
<div id="worked-example" class="section level4">
<h4>Worked Example</h4>
<p>If a coin is tossed <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times, and heads is observed 17 times, the sample proportion of heads is <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle{\widehat p = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{17}{25} = 0.68}\)</span>. We will find the probability that a sample proportion will exceed 0.68. Said differently, we will calculate the probability that someone would flip more than 17 heads out of 25 flips of a coin.</p>
<p>First, we compute the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.68\)</span>. We can use the mean and standard deviation, which were calculated back in Question 6, or just simply substitute the values of <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> in the equation for the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{\textrm{value} - \textrm{mean}}{\textrm{standard deviation}}
= \frac{\widehat p - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p \cdot (1-p)}{n}}}
= \frac{0.68 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5 (1-0.5)}{25}}}
= \frac{0.18}{0.1}
= 1.800

<li>Suppose a student flipped a coin <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times and got a sample proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat p = 0.44\)</span>, or 44% of their coin tosses resulted in heads.

<div id="Q11" style="display:none;">
<p><span class="math display">\[
  z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.44 - 0.5}{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)}{25}} = -0.600

<ul>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score for a <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of 0.44 is <span class="math inline">\(z=-0.60\)</span>.</li>

<li>Use the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score you computed in Question 11 to find the probability that the proportion of successes, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat p\)</span>, will be greater than 0.44 if a coin is tossed <span class="math inline">\(n=25\)</span> times.</li>

<li>So the probability of observing a sample proprotion greater than 0.44 is <span class="math inline">\(0.7257\)</span> as shown by the “Area” box in the Normal Probability Applet for a z-score of <span class="math inline">\(z=-0.6\)</span>.</li>

<a href="javascript:showhide('Q13')"><span style="font-size:8pt;">Show/Hide Solution</span></a>

<p>We already know that the z-score for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}=0.44\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(z=-0.6\)</span> from our work in Question 11. Now we compute the z-score for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}=0.56\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.56 - 0.5}{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)}{25}} = 0.600

<h4>Example: Political Elections</h4>
<p>During political elections in the United States, residents are inundated with polls. Many people conduct polls to estimate the proportion of the population that will vote for each candidate. The pollsters report the number of people who were contacted and the proportion who said they would favor a particular candidate. The poll results are a prediction of the future election results.</p>
<p>In these polls, individuals are asked the question, “If the election were held today, which candidate would you most likely support?” In one survey, <span class="math inline">\(n=1024\)</span> people were polled, and <span class="math inline">\(x=565\)</span> of the respondents said that they would vote for the Republican candidate. In this case, the “proportion” of people who favored the Republican candidate was: <span class="math display">\[
\widehat p = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{565}{1024} = 0.552
\]</span> That suggests that 55.2% of the people polled plan to vote for the Republican. This does not mean that this candidate will win the election. However, it looks like they might be in the lead at this point.</p>
<p>Consider the following question:</p>
<p>“If the true proportion of people who support a particular political candidate is <span class="math inline">\(p=0.48\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(n=1041\)</span> people are surveyed, what is the probability that the results of the survey will suggest that the candidate will win the election?”</p>
<p>To address this question, we first note that the survey will suggest that the candidate will win if more than 50% of the people surveyed favor the candidate. So, we need to find the following probability: <span class="math inline">\(P(\widehat p &gt; 0.5)\)</span>. First we find the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{\widehat p - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.5-0.48}{\sqrt{\frac{0.48(1-0.48)}{1041}}} = 1.292
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, we look up this value using the Normal Probability Applet and find the area to the right. Using the Normal Probability Applet, we find that <span class="math inline">\(P(\widehat p &gt; 0.5)=0.0982\)</span>. So, even though this candidate is actually behind in the popular vote, there is a chance of 0.0982 that they will appear to be winning!</p>
<p>This calculation was done in the same way we have done normal calculations in the past. The only difference is that instead of using <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> and its mean and standard deviation, we used <span class="math inline">\(\widehat p\)</span> and its mean and standard deviation. Otherwise, they are the same.</p>
