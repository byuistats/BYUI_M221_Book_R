<h2>The Ethan Allen</h2>
<p><img src="Images/The_Judge_Ben_Wiles_(TJG).jpg">
<!--|From [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Judge_Ben_Wiles_(TJG).jpg commons.wikimedia.org]--></p>
<p>A tragic accident on Lake George in New York, USA, called into
question the safety regulations for commercial tour boats. On October 5,
2005, a full boat of 47 passengers and 1 crew member began a routine
one-hour tour of Lake George. As the operator initiated a turn, the tour
boat “Ethan Allen” listed (tipped) enough to take water aboard. The
force caused by dipping beneath the surface caused the vessel to list,
shifting the passengers to one side of the boat. After this shift in the
weight distribution, the boat capsized killing 20 passengers and
injuring 9 others.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p>We assume that at the time of the accident, the stability
requirements were based on the Coast Guard criteria of a mean of 140
pounds per person. So, the Ethan Allen was supposed to be able to safely
transport passengers and crew with a mean weight of 140 pounds. We want
to investigate if 140 pounds is a reasonable value for the mean weight
of tour boat passengers. This leads to the research question: “Is the
mean weight of tour boat passengers greater than 140 pounds?”</p>
<p>We can rewrite the research question in a declarative sentence to
obtain a hypothesis, or a testable statement about a population.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis we will write is that the Coast Guard criteria
is appropriate: “The mean weight of tour boat passengers is 140 pounds.”
We call this the null hypothesis. The <strong>null hypothesis</strong>
is a statement of the “status quo”, or the value typically considered to
be appropriate. Notice that the null hypothesis is expressed with a
statement involving equality (<span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0:~~\mu = 140\)</span> pounds</p>
<p>In contrast to the null hypothesis, we write the alternative
hypothesis. This is typically the statement that a researcher suspects
is the actual truth. In our case, we suspect that “The mean weight of
tour boat passengers is greater than 140 pounds.”</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_a:~~\mu &gt; 140\)</span> pounds</p>
<p>We label the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>
and the alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.
In every hypothesis test in this class, the null hypothesis will be a
statement involving equality. The alternative hypothesis can include
greater than (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>), less than
(<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>), or not equal (<span
class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>).</p>
<p>When we test hypotheses, we assume the null hypothesis is true.
Because of this requirement, whenever we need to use μ in a calculation,
we can use the value specified in the null hypothesis. When we conduct a
hypothesis test, we gather evidence against the requirement that the
null hypothesis is true. If we get enough evidence against the null
hypothesis, we reject it. If we do not have sufficient evidence against
the null hypothesis, we do not reject it.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>How do we gather evidence against a null hypothesis? We collect
data.</p>
<p>The marine accident report gives the weight (in pounds) of each of
the passengers and the crew member. These values are reproduced below.

<p>To help us understand the data, we first create a graph summarizing
the values.</p>

<strong>Weights of Passengers and Crew on the Ethan Allen</strong><br>
<img src="Images/EthanAllen-PassengerWeights-Histogram.png">
</center>
<p>Next, we compute summary statistics. The sample size is <span
class="math inline">\(n=48\)</span>, and the sample mean is <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=177.6\)</span> pounds. According to the
CDC, the standard deviation of the weights of individuals in the United
States is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=26.7\)</span> pounds.
<!-- CITE: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/2000growthchart-us.pdf, page 154-155.--></p>
<p>Considering the data as a random sample of all possible tour boat
passengers, it appears that the true mean weight of tour boat passengers
might be greater than 140 pounds. However, we need to check this with a
formal test of our hypotheses.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step4.png"></p>
<p>It is not sufficient to gain an intuitive sense for the data. We will
test if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that
the true mean weight of tour boat passengers is 140 pounds.</p>
<p>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that we
would observe a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the values
we observed? This probability is called the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value.</p>
<p>To find the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, we first
calculate the number of standard deviations that <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is away from the assumed value of
true mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu=140\)</span> pounds. This is
our <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score. Then we use the applet
to determine the probability of observing a value of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that is as large or larger than the
value we observed.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\displaystyle{ z= \frac{ \bar{x} −
\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{177.6−140}{26.7/\sqrt{48}}=9.757
}\]</span></p>
<p>We use the applet to determine the probability of observing a value
of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that is as large or larger
than <span class="math inline">\(9.757\)</span>. This is the same as the
probability of observing a value of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}
=177.6\)</span> or more pounds, given that the true mean really is <span
class="math inline">\(\mu = 140\)</span> pounds.</p>
<p>The area to the right of <span class="math inline">\(z=9.757\)</span>
is so small, the normal probability applet gives the area as
“8.6086e-23.” This is how a computer represents scientific notation.
This number is actually <span
class="math inline">\(8.6086ex10^{-23}\)</span> or in other words, 0.000
000 000 000 000 000 000 086 086. This is the probability that a mean of
<span class="math inline">\(\bar x=177.6\)</span> pounds or greater was
observed just by chance assuming the true mean is <span
class="math inline">\(\mu = 140\)</span> lbs. This is very, very
unlikely. A more plausible explanation is that the true mean weight
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> of individuals in the
population is greater than 140 pounds.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis and the hypothesis test, the evidence against
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is strong enough to conclude
that if every seat on the Ethan Allen was occupied, that the boat would
be carrying a greater load than it was certified to handle.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Step5.png"></p>
<p>As a result of this accident, the United States government took
several actions. The Coast Guard stability regulations were changed, and
the assumed average weight per person was increased to 185 pounds.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered how it was determined that the true mean body
temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° ?</p>
<p>It is not exactly clear who first reported this value, but this
temperature has been used since the 1800’s.
<!-- \cite{Mackowiak92,Horvath50} --> One of the most influential
researchers in this area is Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich. He reported
measuring over 1,000,000 body temperatures on over 20,000
patients.<!-- \cite{Mackowiak92,Wunderlich68} --> When the temperature
is measured in the arm pit, it is called an axillary temperature
measurement. Based on his research, Wunderlich stated, “The axillary
temperature of 98.6° F = 37° C<span
class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>is considered the central thermic
point of health”. <!-- \cite{Wunderlich71}--> In other words, the mean

<p>A group of researchers led by Philip A. Mackowiak, MD, conducted a
study to assess the true mean body temperatures of healthy
adults.<!-- \cite{Mackowiak92}--> They selected <span

reported in a paper published in the “Journal of the American Medical
Association”. <!-- \cite{Mackowiak92}--> These data were extracted and
are presented in the file <a href="./Data/BodyTemp.xlsx">BodyTemp</a>.

<h2>Hypothesis Test for the True Mean Body Temperature</h2>
<div id="null-and-alternative-hypotheses" class="section level3">
<h3>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
<p>It is commonly believed that the true mean body temperature is 98.6°
F (37° C). In science, a statement or claim such as this is called a
<strong>hypothesis</strong>. We can use data to test a hypothesis. If
there is enough evidence against a hypothesis, we reject it in favor of
something else.</p>
<p>The claim representing the “status quo” or the commonly held belief
or the usual value is called the <strong>null hypothesis</strong>. In
the case of body temperatures, our null hypothesis is defined by the
belief that the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6°
F.</p>
<p>We present the null hypothesis in the following way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu = 98.6\]</span></p>
<p>If we gather enough evidence against the null hypothesis and
determine that it should be rejected, we need another hypothesis to
propose in its place. This is called the <strong>alternative
hypothesis</strong>. If 98.6° F is not the correct body temperature,
then it is logical to propose the following alternative hypothesis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\]</span></p>
<p>To be brief in writing, we label the null hypothesis <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The zero in the subscript represents
“null,” “baseline,” “default,” “no effect,” etc. Similarly, we label the
alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our alternative hypothesis could have been written as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\)</span> (two-sided
hypothesis; two-tailed)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu &lt; 98.6\)</span> (one-sided
hypothesis; left-tailed)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu &gt; 98.6\)</span> (one-sided
hypothesis; right-tailed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that each of these is a viable alternative to the requirement
that the mean is 98.6 degrees. We would only use <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> if we had a belief in advance that
the mean was less than or greater than 98.6. If we do not have a strong
reason to believe the mean is either smaller or larger than the stated
value–before we collect our data–then, we use <span
class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span> in our alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is important that the null and alternative hypotheses be
determined prior to collecting the data. It is not appropriate to use
the data from your study to choose the alternative hypothesis that will
be used to test the same data! This is an example of using data twice,
once to choose the test and again to conduct the test. It is okay to use
data from a previous study to determine your null and alternative
hypotheses, but it is an improper use of the statistical procedures to
use the data to define <em>and</em> conduct a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>Notice that the null and alternative hypotheses are statements about
a population parameter (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.)
They will never involve a sample statistic (e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.) Population parameters are
unknown, and we are trying to make a judgement about whether or not they
are equal to a particular value. Sample statistics are calculated from
our data, so there is no reason to do any test to assess what their
value is.</p>
<!--
{| class="wikitable"
|-

See Lesson \ref{Reading:SampDistOfXbar} to review the concept of the distribution of sample means, $\bar{x}$.
|}
-->
<p>The null hypothesis will always be a statement involving equality.
This gives us a starting point in our analysis. In the reading for <a
href="Lesson05.html" target="_blank">Normal Distributions</a>, we
assumed that the true mean body temperature was 98.6° F. This becomes
the assumed value of the mean of the distribution of the random variable
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The scientific method demands that we make a hypothesis (a claim or
an educated guess). We assume that the null hypothesis is true and
gather evidence against it. In other words, we “do research” (e.g.,
collect data) to gather evidence against that hypothesis. If we can
gather enough evidence to discredit our initial hypothesis, we conclude
that it was false, and begin the process again. If we are unable to
reject the original hypothesis, we do not conclude that it is correct.
For example, we do not know that Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is
correct. We have simply not been able to disprove it<span
class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>yet.</p>
<p>In the same way, we never can prove a null hypothesis is true. We can
only gather evidence against it. If we get enough evidence, we reject
the null hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="test-statistic" class="section level3">
<h3>Test Statistic</h3>
<p>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, we assume that the true mean
body temperature of healthy adults actually is <span
class="math inline">\(\mu = 98.6^{\circ}\)</span> F. Wanting to test
this claim, researchers collected data on the mean body temperatures of
<span class="math inline">\(n=148\)</span> healthy adults. The mean of
the observed values was <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x} =
98.23^{\circ}\)</span> F.</p>
<p>A histogram of the body temperature data shows a nice bell-shaped
distribution. Also, the sample mean, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=98.23^\circ\)</span> F, appears to be
reasonably close to the assumed population mean, <span
class="math inline">\(\mu=98.6^\circ\)</span> F. However, it is
important to remember that the standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} =
\frac{0.675}{\sqrt{148}}=0.055\)</span>. We need to determine how far
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is from <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Since we know <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in this case, we can use the <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score to determine if <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is far from the assumed value.
This is called the <strong>test statistic</strong>: <span
class="math display">\[
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{98.23 - 98.6}{0.675
/ \sqrt{148}} = -6.6685
\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the test
statistic, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the sample
mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the population mean,
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation
and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. Based on
the results from the formula above, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is over 6 standard deviations
below the mean!</p>
</div>
<div id="p-value" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value</h3>
<div id="definition" class="section level4">
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value</strong> is
the probability of obtaining a test statistic (such as <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) at least as extreme as the one you
calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, our
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the probability that we
would get a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score that is as
extreme or more extreme than <span
class="math inline">\(z=-6.6685\)</span>, assuming the true mean is
98.6° F.</p>
<p>In advance of collecting the data, we may have had no idea whether
the true mean would be greater than 98.6 or less than 98.6, if 98.6° F
was not the right value. This is why we used a two-sided alternative
hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_a: \mu \ne 98.6\)</span>.)
When computing the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, we need
to continue this logic. So, we would have considered a value of <span
class="math inline">\(z=-6.6685\)</span> to be equally as extreme as
<span class="math inline">\(z=6.6685\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of a two-sided test for one mean with <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known, the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area in the tails beyond
<span class="math inline">\(\pm z\)</span>, in both the left and right
tails of the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Applet2584E-11-twosided-LoR.png"></p>
<p>Using the applet, we shade the area in both tails and then type in
the value of <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span>. The applet
reports an area of “2.584E-11.” This is the way computers indicate
scientific notation. Expressed using more traditional notation, we
get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P\text{-value} = 2.584 \times 10^{-11}
= 0.000~000~000~026 \]</span></p>
<p>You should always convert the computer’s notation involving “E” to
scientific notation or decimal notation.</p>
<div class="Emphasis">
<p>  <strong>Scientific Notation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scientific notation is a method used to write very large or very
small numbers without a lot of extra zeros. Computers express scientific
notation using the letter “E.” For example, to write <span
class="math inline">\(7.8\times 10^3\)</span>, a computer would output
the expression 7.8E3. For example, the number <span
class="math inline">\(7.8\times 10^3\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(7.8 \times 1000=7800\)</span>, since <span
class="math inline">\(10^3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000\)</span>.
Another way to think of this is to move the decimal place in the number
7.8 three places to the right, which gives you <span
class="math display">\[ 7~\underset{\rightarrow}{8}
\underset{\rightarrow}{0} \underset{\rightarrow}{0}. \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This is an example of how very large numbers can be represented.
To express small numbers (close to zero,) we use negative exponents. The
number <span class="math inline">\(9.12 \times 10^{-5}\)</span> is the
same as <span class="math inline">\(9.12 \times (10^5)^{-1} = 9.12
\times (10000)^{-1}\)</span>. This can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(9.12 \times 0.00001 = 0.0000912\)</span>. Since
the exponent on the 10 is <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span>, you
move the decimal place in the number 9.1 five places to the
left:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span
class="math display">\[0.\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{0}\underset{\leftarrow}{9}~1~2\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, the value <span class="math inline">\(2.57552 \times
10^{-11}\)</span> can be written in regular notation as <span
class="math inline">\(0.000~000~000~025~755~2\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is small, that
implies that the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score was very
large (far away from 0.) In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> was far away from <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. In this case, our <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score was 6.669 standard deviations
below the mean. It is very unusual to get a value of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> that is this far from the value
of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given in the null
hypothesis. This implies that it is not plausible that the mean is equal
to 98.6° F. We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is
sufficient evidence that the true mean body temperature of healthy
adults is not 98.6° F.</p>
<p>If this conclusion is correct, you may wonder why so many people
think the true mean body temperature of healthy adults is 98.6° F (37°
C). Good question!</p>
</div>
<div id="relationship-to-the-alternative-hypothesis"
class="section level4">
<h4>Relationship to the Alternative Hypothesis</h4>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is determined using
the alternative hypothesis. If the alternative hypothesis is two-sided
(i.e. if the alternative hypothesis involves <span
class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span>,) then the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area in the tails further
than <span class="math inline">\(\pm z\)</span>. That is, it is the area
to the left of <span class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span> plus the
area to the right of <span class="math inline">\(z=+6.669\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the alternative hypothesis involves less than (such as <span
class="math inline">\(\mu&lt;98.6\)</span>,) we call it a left-tailed
test. For a left-tailed test, the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area under the standard
normal curve to the left of the test statistic, <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of a right-tailed test, the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is the area to the right of the
test statistic, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In cases of very large or very small <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> statistics sometimes the shaded area is
so small it can’t be seen. This is the case for <span
class="math inline">\(z=-6.669\)</span>. It is such an extreme value for
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, it is hard to see the actual
shading. However, shading is happening and the applet is calculating the
right p-value. To help you visually see how the shading works, the three
possibilities for alternative hypotheses are illustrated in the figures
below, using a less extreme value of <span
class="math inline">\(z=-1.6\)</span>.</p>

<p>How do we decide if the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value

<p>We will use the same decision rule for all hypothesis tests. If the
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is less than <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we reject the null hypothesis.
Conversely, if the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is
greater than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we fail to
reject the null hypothesis. The level of significance, <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, must be chosen prior to
collecting the data. This is our standard for determining if the null
hypothesis should be rejected. It is important that the personal bias of
the researcher is not imposed on the data. So, we choose the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level prior to collecting the
data. If we wanted to reject the null hypothesis, we could compute the
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value and then unscrupulously
choose the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level. In every
case, we could choose a value of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> that is larger than the computed
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, and therefore always
reject the null hypothesis. This practice would defeat the purpose of
hypothesis testing.</p>
</div>
<div id="type-i-and-type-ii-errors" class="section level3">
<h3>Type I and Type II Errors</h3>
<p>If the null hypothesis is true, for example, if the true body
temperature of healthy adults really is 98.6° F, sometimes we will get a
very large or very small value of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>. This will lead to a very extreme
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score, strictly due to chance. In
this case, we would reject the null hypothesis, even though it is
true!</p>
<p>Whenever we reject a true null hypothesis, we say that a <strong>Type
I error</strong> was committed. Assuming the null hypothesis is true,
the level of significance (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)
is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic that is
extreme enough that the null hypothesis will be rejected. In other
words, the level of significance (<span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) is the probability of committing
a Type I error.</p>
<p>We choose <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to be some
small number so that the probability of committing a Type I error is
low. The most common value for <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>. This is equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span>. So, when the null
hypothesis is true, there is a one-in-twenty chance that it will be
rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. Other common choices for
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> include <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.01\)</span>.</p>
<p>If committing a Type I error is undesirable, why can’t we let <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span>? This would make it impossible
to commit a Type I error. Actually, this would also make it impossible
to reject “any” null hypothesis! If <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span>, no matter what test we do, no
matter what the data show, we always fail to reject the null hypothesis.
This would be pointless.</p>
<p>A Type I error is committed when we reject a true null hypothesis.
Another problem that can arise is to fail to reject a false null
hypothesis. This is called a Type II error. The probability of a Type II
error is represented by <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>

<p>We do not want to commit Type I errors, so why not choose a very
small value for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>? If we
choose <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to be so small that
we rarely commit a Type I error, what would happen to the probability of
committing a Type II error? (Think about it.)</p>
<p>If the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> value (the
probability of committing a Type I error) is very small, the probability
of committing a Type II error will be large. Conversely, if <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is allowed to be very large, then
the probability of committing a Type II error will be very small. A
level of significance of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> seems to strike a good
balance between the probabilities of committing a Type I versus a Type
II error. However, there may be instances where it will be important to
choose a different value for <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. The important thing is to choose
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> before you collect your
data. Typical choices of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> are
<span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span> (most common), <span

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Certain requirements are required for us to conduct the hypothesis
test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>
known.</p>
<p>First of all, we must assume that the data represent a simple random
sample from a large population. In practice, this requirement is rarely
satisfied. Frequently researchers working with humans rely on
convenience samples, where the subjects volunteer to participate in a
research project. The researcher may advertise using television, radio,
and flyers in a clinic. If there is no relationship between the issue
being studied and people’s desire to participate, this method works
fairly well.</p>
<p>A second requirement is that the data are drawn from a population
that has a normal distribution with mean <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> given in the null hypothesis
(e.g. 98.6° F) and a known standard deviation (e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma=0.675^\circ\)</span> F.)</p>
<p>It turns out that the procedure actually works quite well–even if the
data are not normally distributed–as long as <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> follows a normal distribution.
Under what conditions will <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>
be normally distributed? (Think about it.)</p>
<p>In the reading for <a href="Lesson06.html"
target="_blank">Distribution of Sample Means &amp; The Central Limit
Theorem|Lesson 6</a>, we learned that <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> will follow a normal distribution
if the data are drawn from a normal distribution or if the sample size
(<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) is large.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, we can summarize the requirements for a
test for a single mean with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>
known as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data represent a simple random sample from a large
population.</li>
<li>The sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is
normally distributed. This happens if either one of the following is
true:
<ul>
<li>The population is normally distributed.</li>
<li>The sample size is large.</li>

will assume that the population standard deviation is known to be <span

<h2>Worked Example: Perceived Health after a Cardiac Arrest</h2>
<p>A group of researchers led by Dr. Jared Bunch studied the long-term
effects suffered by patients who experienced a cardiac arrest outside a
hospital<!-- \cite{Bunch03} -->. The long-term health of the patients
was assessed using the Short-Form General Health Survey
(SF-36)<!-- \cite{Ware92} --> at the time of their last follow up visit.
The SF-36 is normalized so the mean score in the general population is
<span class="math inline">\(\mu=50\)</span> and the standard deviation
is <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma=10\)</span><!-- \cite{Jenkinson99} -->. The
minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. Lower scores on the
SF-36 indicate a poorer quality of health.</p>
<p>Using the 0.05 level of significance, we will conduct a hypothesis
test to determine if the mean perceived general health level among
cardiac arrest survivors is less than 50. In other words, we want to
know if the mean perceived overall health is lower among cardiac arrest
survivors than in the general population.</p>
<p>Dr. Bunch summarized the responses in a figure, <!--\cite{Bunch03}-->
from which the data were extracted. These data are given in the file <a

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>There are three requirements that need to be checked when conducting
a hypothesis test for a mean with <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> known:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A simple random sample was drawn from the population</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is normally
distributed</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is assumed to be
known</li>
</ol>
<p>It is rare for the first requirement to be satisfied in practice. If
the results are to generalize to the population, the sample needs to be
representative of the whole population. This is accomplished through
random sampling.</p>
<p>The second requirement is satisfied if (a) the raw data are normally
distributed or (b) the sample size is large. In practice, these tests
tend to be fairly robust when the requirement of normality is violated.
Even if the requirement of normality is not satisfied perfectly, it is
usually okay to conduct the test.</p>
<p>In practice, we never really know <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. This procedure is primarily used
to help you understand how to conduct a hypothesis test. When we do not
know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, there is a slightly
different procedure, which you will learn soon.</p>

<h3>Mean GPA of early risers</h3>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants 88:124, the Lord commands, “…cease to sleep
longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be
weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.”
Are there academic benefits from obeying this commandment? People who
sleep late tend to be stereotyped as slackers. It is not fair to make
these claims without any scientific evidence. The purpose of this study
is used to address whether early risers earn better grades.</p>
<p>Researcher K. Clay and others presented a paper at the Associated
Professional Sleep Societies meeting [4]. They suggested that the mean
GPA of students who are early risers tends to be higher than average.
The mean grade point average (GPA) of all students at BYU-Idaho is <span
class="math inline">\(\mu = 3.15\)</span>. The population standard
deviation for the grades of students at BYU-Idaho is <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma= 0.68\)</span>.</p>
<p>A simple random sample of <span class="math inline">\(n =

were asked to report their BYU-Idaho GPA. The GPA of each person who was

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The previous examples in this reading illustrate the three types of
alternative hypotheses: two-tailed, left-tailed and right-tailed. In
each case, the structure of the hypothesis test is basically the same.
However, when the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score is
entered into the applet to compute the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, it is important to note whether
to shade both tails, the left tail, or the right tail of the standard
normal or (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) distribution.</p>

<h3>U.S. Criminal Justice System</h3>
<p>In the United States criminal justice system, when a person is
accused of a crime, they are assumed innocent until proven guilty. This
is analogous to the requirement that the null hypothesis is true until
we gather enough evidence to reject it.</p>
<p>A judge or a jury must plant in their mind the requirement of
innocence. At the end of the trial, they must determine if there is
enough evidence to determine “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the person
is guilty. If this standard is met, the judge/jury rejects the
requirement of innocence and declares the defendant “guilty.” However,
if there is not enough evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant is guilty, the judge/jury fails to reject the
requirement of innocence and returns a verdict of “not guilty.”</p>
<p>The judge/jury originally assumed the defendant was innocent, so they
cannot conclude that the person is “innocent” at the end of the trial.
It is not possible to start with the requirement of innocence and
logically used that requirement in the proof of itself.</p>

<div id="why-dont-we-accept-the-null-hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>Why Don’t we Accept the Null Hypothesis?</h3>
<p>It may be hard, but imagine for a moment that <span
class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>. Even though it goes against
everything you thought was true in Mathematics, relax your mind and
assume that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>, then we can apply valid
algebraic operations to both sides of this equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
1 &amp;=&amp; 2     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Assumed true} \\
1(2) &amp;=&amp; 2(2)  &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Multiply both sides by
2} \\
2 &amp;=&amp; 4     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify} \\
2-3 &amp;=&amp; 4-3   &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Subtract 3 from both
sides} \\
-1 &amp;=&amp; 1     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify} \\
(-1)^2 &amp;=&amp; (1)^2 &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Square both sides} \\
1 &amp;=&amp; 1     &amp; \leftarrow \textrm{Simplify}
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>We started with a requirement that <span
class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span> is a true statement. We applied valid
algebraic operations at each step. In the end, we found that <span
class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>, which is certainly no contradiction.
Logically, have we shown that <span
class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>?</p>

<li>What is wrong with the logic in this “proof?”</li>

style="font-size:8pt;">Show/Hide Solution</span></a>
<div id="Q33" style="display:none;">
<ul>
<li>The problem here is that we assumed that <span
class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>, and then we attempted to use that
requirement to prove itself. We cannot use a requirement as evidence of
itself.</li>
<li>However, if we start with a requirement and then find a
contradiction, then we know that our original requirement is not true.
Since this did not happen, we say that we did not get enough evidence
against the requirement that <span
class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>In science, we make a hypothesis (or a statement or claim) and then
we gather evidence “against” that requirement. If we cannot reject the
hypothesis, in the mathematical example above, we started with a
requirement and did not find sufficient evidence against that
requirement. In the end, we arrived at no contradiction at all: <span
class="math inline">\(1=1\)</span>. This did not mean that our original
claim that <span class="math inline">\(1=2\)</span> was true; it only
meant that we had not yet disproved it. We could not reject the original
claim.</p>
<p>We have to be careful when conducting hypothesis tests. When we
conduct a test, we assume the null hypothesis is true. This provides a
distribution for the test statistic, and allows us to calculate the
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value. If we find that the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is large, that means that we did
not find a contradiction in our requirement that the null hypothesis is
true. That does not mean that the null hypothesis is true, it only means
that we cannot reject it. For this reason, we never say we “accept the
null hypothesis.” When the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value
is large, we say that we “fail to reject the null hypothesis.”</p>
</div>
<div id="testimonies-and-hypothesis-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Testimonies and Hypothesis Tests</h3>
<p>The scientific method demands that we make a hypothesis (a claim or
an educated guess). We then “do research” (e.g., collect data) to gather
evidence against that hypothesis. If we can gather enough evidence to
discredit our initial hypothesis, we conclude that it was false, and
begin the process again.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reject the original hypothesis, we do not
conclude that it is correct. For example, just because apples have
always been observed to fall downward out of apple trees, we do not
conclude that the Law of Gravity is correct. However, it has not been
disproved either.</p>
<p>This philosophy is very different from the way one gains a testimony.
A testimony is a Gift of the Spirit, and it is given only by
revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be
deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what
they are given;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those
who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do;
that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not
for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts. And again, verily
I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always
retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the
church. For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many
gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. To some is
given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited
thereby. To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.
To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might
have eternal life if they continue faithful.”</p>

<p>We cannot demand or try to force a gift of the Spirit, or we make
ourselves susceptible to deception. We can only obey, ask, exercise
faith, and wait upon the Lord.</p>
<p>When the gift of a true testimony is given, it does not provide
evidence against a hypothesis, rather it establishes the truth in the
heart of the recipient. A testimony does not follow the scientific
method. A testimony does not provide evidence against some claim, rather
it is the (final) establishment of the truth.</p>
<p>Testimonies need to be nourished, and if neglected, they will perish.
They can be fragile.</p>
<p>When a testimony is given, the truth is planted in the heart. The
testimony from the Holy Ghost makes additional “scientific” inquiry
unnecessary. No additional information can be gained by “testing” a
testimony using the scientific method.</p>
