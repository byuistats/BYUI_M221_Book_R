<h2>Independent Samples Versus Paired Data</h2>
<p>In the previous reading <a href="Lesson12.html">Lesson 12: Inference for Two Means: Paired Data</a>{target = “_blank”} we studied hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for the true mean of the differences <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span>, where the data are paired. One example of paired data is pre- and post-test scores, such as Mahon’s weight loss study. <!--<cite>Mahon07</cite>--> Another example is matched-pairs comparisons, like the nosocomial infection study. <!--<cite>Vegas93</cite>--> How can you tell if data are paired? The key characteristic of dependent samples (or matched pairs, or paired data) is that knowing which subjects will be in Group 1 determines which subjects will be in Group 2. The data for each subject in Group 1 is <em>paired</em> with the data for a corresponding subject in Group 2. In the case of the weight loss study, the same subject provided weight data for both groups: once in the pre-test (group 1) and once in the post-test (group 2).</p>
<p>In contrast to dependent samples, two samples are independent if knowing which subjects are in Group 1 tells you nothing about which subjects will be in Group 2. With <strong>independent samples</strong>, there is no pairing between the groups. Suppose you want to compare the incomes of men and women in the general population. A random sample of men would be collected, and each would be asked to report their income. Similarly, a random sample of women would be drawn, and they would also be asked to report their income. Notice that the groups are independent. Knowing the names of the men who are selected tells you nothing about which women would be selected. This is an example of independent samples.</p>
<p>We can compare the mean income of men to the mean income of women using the procedures of this section. We will conduct hypothesis tests and compute confidence intervals for the difference in the true population means of two groups (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{DEV Group} - \mu_\text{GEN Group}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Some students make the association that samples are independent if they do not affect each other. This is a false notion. Instead, remember that <em>samples are independent if knowing who was selected for Group A tells you nothing about who will be selected for group B.</em></p>

<h3>Case Study: Reading Practices of Children with Developmental or Behavioral Problems</h3>
<p>Is there a difference in the amount of reading done by children with problematic behavior compared to other children?</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Summarize the relevant background information</strong></p>
<p>Researchers led by Arlene Butz published a study on the reading practices of children <!--<cite>Butz09</cite>-->. They wanted to know if there was a difference in the reading practices of children with developmental or behavioral problems (the DEV group or Group 1) compared to children in the general population who do not have developmental problems (the GEN group or Group 2.) One of the factors they considered was the number of nights each week that the children participated in reading in the home. Data representative of their results are given in the file <a href="./data/reading.xlsx">reading.xlsx</a>.</p>
<p><strong>State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance</strong></p>
<p>The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean number of nights each week in which the two groups of children participate in reading in the home (the means of both GEN and DEV groups are equal). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the mean number of nights that the children in the two groups participate in reading in the home. If we let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> represent the mean number of nights each week that children in the GEN Group spent reading in the home, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> represent mean nights children read in the home for the DEV Group, then these hypotheses are expressed mathematically as: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
H_0: &amp;~~ \mu_1 = \mu_2 \\
H_a: &amp;~~  \mu_1  \neq \mu_2 
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will use the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> level of significance.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Describe the data collection procedures</strong></p>
<p>A group of children were enrolled in the study. Children who were identified to have developmental or behavioral problems were labeled as Group 1 (the DEV group). Children who did not display developmental or behavioral problems were labeled as Group 2 (the GEN group). A survey was administered to a parent of each of the children. One of the questions on the survey asked the number of nights that either their child read or that they read to their child during the week. This data is found in the file <a href="./data/reading.xlsx">reading.xlsx</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To compute numerical summaries for two groups at once:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, read the data into RStudio: <a href="./data/reading.xlsx">reading.xlsx</a>. (Review of <a href="RHelp.html#reading-in-the-data">reading in data</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Second, load the <code>mosaic</code> library in RStudio that makes calculating the numerical summaries for two groups really quick.</p></li>

<div class="note">
<p>If you get the error message <span style="color:red;">Error in library(mosaic) : there is no package called ‘mosaic’</span> then you will need to install the <code>mosiac</code> package using the code: <code>install.packages("mosaic")</code></p>
<p>You’ll only ever need to “install” this package once. But you’ll need to run “library(mosaic)” every time you reopen RStudio and want to use the <code>mosaic</code> package. As long as you keep RStudio open, you won’t have to re-load the mosaic library.</p>
</div>
<p>Use the <code>favstats(...)</code> function and the tilde <code>~</code> (top-left key on your keyboard) to produce numerical summaries for two or more groups. When using the <code>~</code> you put the quantitative variable first, followed by the <code>~</code>, then the categorical variable second, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>favstats(reading$nights ~ reading$group)</code></pre>
<pre><code>  reading$group min Q1 median Q3 max     mean       sd   n missing

<li>Answers will vary. We will conduct a hypothesis test to formally determine the answer to this question. But based on the data, it seems that the DEV group is spending more time, on average, reading in the home than the GEN group. This seems surprising because the “DEV” group is the one with “developmental or behavioral problems.”</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step4.png"></p>
<p><strong>Verify the requirements have been met</strong></p>
<p>There are two requirements that need to be checked when conducting a hypothesis test for two means with independent samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple random sample was drawn from each of the populations</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_2\)</span> are both normally distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, the second requirement will be satisfied if (a) the original populations are normally distributed or (b) if the sample sizes are large. If either of these options are true, then the sample mean will be normally distributed for that group. In this example, both groups have a large sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n_1 = 204\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 117\)</span>), so both sample means can be assumed to be normally distributed.</p>
<p>We will assume the data from the study is a representative sample from each of the populations.</p>
<p><strong>Give the test statistic and its value</strong></p>
<p>The test statistic for a hypothesis test comparing two means with independent samples is a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We will use software tools to conduct the hypothesis test for two means with independent samples:</p>

#### Pooled

Let the DEV group be called Group 1, and GEN group will be called Group 2.  So, $\mu_1$ is the true population mean of the DEV group, $\bar x_1$ is the sample mean for the DEV group, $n_1$ is the sample size for the DEV group, etc.  Similarly, $\mu_2$ is the true population mean of the GEN group, and so on.

We will do the hypothesis test by following these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
- State the null and alternative hypotheses.
$$
\begin{align}
H_0: & \mu_1 = \mu_2
H_a: & \mu_1 \ne \mu_2
\end{align}
$$
- Give the relevant summary statistics.

We will use the variable, *GroupCode*, that was described above.
The output from the command the command \Menuuu{Analyze}{Compare Means}{Independent-Samples T Test} is summarized below:
<center>
<img src = "./Images/Reading-TtestOutput.png">
</center>
Our summary statistics are:
$$
\begin{array}{|rl|c|rl|}

colspan = "2" | \textrm{Group 1} && colspan = "2" | \textrm{Group 2} \\
colspan = "2" | \textrm{DEV} && colspan = "2" | \textrm{GEN} \\

\bar x_1 & = 4.10    && \bar x_2 & = 3.68 \\
s_1 & = 2.377        && s_2 & = 2.545 \\
n_1 & = 204          && n_2 & = 117 \\

\end{array}
$$
Since the larger standard deviation is not double the smaller standard deviation, we can assume equal variances.
- Present a graph illustrating the data.
<center>
<img src = "./Images/Reading-Histograms.png">
</center>
- Report the test statistic.
Since the larger standard deviation is not double the smaller standard deviation, we conclude that the variances can be treated as being equal.  So, our test statistic, $t$, is:
$$
t = 1.482$$
Note that if you reverse the assignment of the group names, then you would get a $t$ value of $-1.482$.
- Give the degrees of freedom.
$$
df = 319$$
- Sketch the sampling distribution, showing the test statistic and shading the $P$-value.
<center>
<img src = "./Images/Reading-Sketch.png">
</center>
- State the $P$-value.
$$
P\textrm{-value} = 0.139$$
- Give the decision rule for the test.
Since $P$-value$ = 0.139 > 0.05 = \alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- Summarize your conclusion in an English sentence.
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that there is a difference in the mean number of nights children with developmental / behavioral disabilities read compared to children in the general population.

<h3>Case Study: FIFA World Cup Heart Attacks</h3>
<p>Do intense sporting events increase the probability of a person having a heart attack? We will consider this question in the next example.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Soccer-City-Stadium-at-capacity.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Summarize the relevant background information</strong></p>
<p>The FIFA Football (Soccer) World Cup is held every four years and is one of the biggest sporting events in the world. In 2006, Germany hosted the World Cup. A study was conducted by Dr. Wilbert-Lampen, et. al. to determine if the stress of viewing a soccer match would increase the risk of a heart attack or another cardiovascular event. <!--<cite>WilbertLampen08</cite>--></p>
<p>We will use the data on cardiovascular problems during the World Cup to test the hypothesis that the mean number of cardiovascular events is greater during the World Cup than during the control period.</p>
<p><strong>State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance</strong></p>
<p>Let Group 1 be days in the Control Period and let Group 2 represent days during the 2006 World Cup. We are testing whether the mean number of cardiovascular events is greater during the World Cup than during the control period. Since we let Group 1 be the “Control Period”, the alternative hypothesis will be one-sided with a less-than symbol because “Control less than during the 2006 World Cup” is the proper way to state that Group 2 is greater than Group 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
H_0: &amp; ~~ \mu_1 = \mu_2 \\
H_a: &amp; ~~ \mu_1 &lt; \mu_2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will use the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.01\)</span> level of significance. Remember, we are always free to choose our significance level, but since it controls the probability of a Type I Error occurring, we need to consider how problematic a Type I Error would be for our study. In this case, it isn’t terribly detrimental to commit a Type I Error (rejecting the null when the null was actually true), so we go with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Describe the data collection procedures</strong></p>
<p>The 2006 World Cup was held from June 9 to July 9, 2006. The number of patients suffering cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attacks) was obtained from medical records of patients in the Greater Munich (Germany) area during this time period. To provide a control group, counts of patients suffering cardiovascular events was recorded from May 1 to June 8 and July 10 to July 30, 2006, as well as May 1 to July 30 in 2003 and 2005. The year 2004 was avoided, due to the European Soccer Championships held in Portugal. These data were extracted from Figure 1 in the article by Wilbert-Lampen, <!--<cite>WilbertLampen08</cite>--> and are given in the file <a href="./data/fifa_heart_attacks.xlsx">fifa_heart_attacks.xlsx</a>.</p>

<h4>Statistics Theory: Independent Samples t Test</h4>
<p>In this course, we do not go very deep into statistical theory. For those students who are interested, there is a lot of theory undergirding statistical practice that you will be able to study in other statistics courses here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p>For now, know that an important theoretical issue relates to this independent samples hypothesis test. If the variances of the two groups are equal, then traditional statistical theory suggests that you combine or <em>pool</em> the information about the variance in the two groups. If the variances are not equal, you do not combine the information about the spread. These two techniques usually lead to slightly different values for the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic, degrees of freedom, and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value.</p>
<p>If the variances observed in the sample data are very different from each other, you assume unequal variances and do not pool the data. However, if the variances are very similar to each other, the results of the two procedures will be nearly identical. In this case, it does not really matter which you choose.</p>
<p>So, if the variances differ significantly, we should not assume equal variances. If the variances do not differ significantly, it doesn’t really matter if you assume equal variances or not. So, for this course, we will never assume the variances are equal. Stated, differently, we always assume unequal variances in this course. This provides a consistent framework for your learning.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Reading Practices of Children with Developmental or Behavioral Problems (Revisited)</h3>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Summarize the relevant background information</strong></p>
<p>As we stated previously in this lesson, researchers led by Arlene Butz published a study on the reading practices of children. They wanted to know if there was a difference in the reading practices of children with developmental or behavioral problems (the DEV group) compared to children in the general population who do not have developmental problems (the GEN group.) One of the factors they considered was the number of nights each week that the children participated in reading in the home.</p>
<p>We can use a 95% confidence interval to compare the difference between the true mean number of nights children in the DEV group participated in reading compared to children in the GEN group. We are trying to find an estimate for the difference in the true means of the two groups. Using math symbols, we want to estimate the value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>. The confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for the unknown parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that if <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)</span>, if we add <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> to both sides of the equation, we get: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>. Extending that idea, if zero is in the confidence interval, then it is plausible that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>. If zero is in the confidence interval, we conclude that there is no significant difference between the mean number of nights the children in the two groups read at home.</p>
<p>Software can be used to compute the confidence interval for a difference of two means with independent samples.</p>

<p><strong>Describe the data collection procedures</strong></p>
<p>In the study by Arlene Butz, et.al., on the reading practices of children, the researchers wanted to determine if there was a difference in the mean number of nights children read in the two groups (DEV and GEN)<!--<cite>Butz09</cite>-->. A survey was given to the child’s caretaker (usually a parent). This survey included questions about the child’s development and behavior. The survey also asked the number of nights each week that the child participated in reading in the home. Data representative of their results are given in the file <a href="./data/reading.xlsx">reading.xlsx</a>.</p>

<h3>R Instructions for a Confidence Interval of the Difference of Two Means</h3>

Note that this confidence interval contains zero, so it is plausible that there is no difference in the mean number of nights the children in the two groups participate in reading.

</div>
<div id="reversing-the-order-of-groups" class="section level3">
<h3>Reversing the Order of Groups</h3>
<p>When creating the confidence interval in R, it is important to remember that R splits the data into two groups alphabetically. So the “DEV” group is the first group and the “GEN” group is the second group. If this order were reversed, it would result in a confidence interval with the opposite sign. If we assign the GEN group as the first group and the DEV group as the second, we would get a confidence interval of <span class="math inline">\((-0.987, 0.149)\)</span>. We could do this with the code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reading$groupReversed &lt;- factor(reading$group, levels = c(&quot;GEN&quot;, &quot;DEV&quot;), ordered = TRUE)

<h3>Case Study: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</h3>
<p><img src = "Images/StepsAll.png"></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Summarize the relevant background information</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute gives the following explanation of COPD <!--<cite>NHLBI09</cite>-->:</p>
<p>COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. “Progressive” means the disease gets worse over time.</p>
<p>COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus (a slimy substance), wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust, also may contribute to COPD.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Describe the data collection procedures</strong></p>
<p>A study was conducted in the United Kingdom to determine if there is a difference in the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation program compared to hospital-based rehabilitation <!--<cite>Waterhouse10</cite>-->. Patients suffering from COPD were randomly assigned to either the community or hospital group. Twice a week for six weeks, they participated in two-hour educational and exercise sessions. Patients were also encouraged to exercise between sessions.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the program was measured based on the total distance patients could walk at one time at a particular pace. This is called the endurance shuttle walking test (ESWT). This was measured at the beginning of the study and again at the end of the six week rehabilitation period. Data representing the improvement of the patients in each group is given in the file <a href="./data/copd_rehab.xlsx">copd_rehab.xlsx</a>. The data represent the increased distance (in meters) that each patient could walk. Negative values indicate that the patient was not able to walk as far at the end of the rehabilitation treatment as at the beginning.</p>
<p>Because hospital-based rehabilitation tends to be more expensive, the researchers wanted to assess if there is a significant difference in the patients’ improvement under the two programs. If not, then it makes sense to refer patients to the less expensive treatment option. The purpose of this study was to determine if pulmonary rehabilitation in a community setting is as effective as rehabilitation in a hospital setting.</p>
