## Introduction
In this section, we will explore three different, but related hypothesis tests. We will not compute confidence intervals for these tests. 
The first test we will consider is a test for several proportions.  This is used when one categorical variable is measured on units (i.e. subjects) within several populations or treatment groups.  The test for two proportions measures a categorical variable that can take one of two values for subjects in two populations.  The test for several proportions is the natural extension of the test for two proportions.  With this test, we measure a categorical variable across several proportions.

Next, we will explore a test for independence of two categorical variables.  This procedure applies when two categorical variables are measured on each subject.  This test is used to determine whether there is a relationship between the two variables.

Lastly, we will study a test to determine whether the values of a categorical variable follow a specified distribution.

The three tests are related in that they rely in much the same way on frequencies. We can't do arithmetic with categorical data for the purpose of calculating a test statistic, like we can with numeric data. Our only recourse is to convert categorical data into numbers from which a test statistic *can* be calculated. Frequencies can be used for this purpose.

## The $\chi^2$ (Chi-square) Test for Several Proportions
### Nurses' Weight Loss

<h2>The <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> (Chi-squared) Test
of Independence</h2>
<p><img src="Images/Oc-chiropractor.jpg"></p>
<p>People often wonder whether two things influence each other. For
example, people seek chiropractic care for different reasons. We may
want to know if those reasons are different for Europeans than for
Americans or Australians. This question can be expressed as “Do reasons
for seeking chiropractic care depend on the location in which one
lives?”</p>
<p>This question has only two possible answers: “yes” and “no.” The
answer “no” can be written as “Motivations for seeking chiropractic care
and one’s location are independent.” (The statistical meaning of
“independent” is too technical to give here. However, for now, you can
think of it as meaning that the two variables are not associated in any
way. For example, neither variable depends on the other.) Writing the
answer “no” this way allows us to use it as the null hypothesis of a
test. We can write the alternative hypothesis by expressing the answer
“yes” as “Motivations for seeking chiropractic care and one’s location
are not independent.” (Reasons for wording it this way will be given
after you’ve been through the entire hypothesis test.)</p>
<p>To prepare for the hypothesis test, recall that our hypothesis tests
always measure how different two or more things are. For example, in the
2-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, we compare two
population means by seeing how different they are. In a test of one
proportion, we measure the difference between a sample proportion and a
population proportion. Each of these tests requires some information
about at least one parameter. That information is given in the null
hypothesis of the test, which we’ve always been able to write with one
or more “=” signs, because we’ve always used numeric parameters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have no parameter we can use to measure the
independence of the variables “location” and “motivation”. Nevertheless,
we have to be able to calculate a <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, and the only approach we have so
far is to measure differences between things. “Difference” means
“subtraction” in Statistics, and if the measurements are categorical, we
cannot subtract them. Therefore, as in the other lessons of this unit,
we will count occurrences of each value of each variable to get some
numbers. (The example that follows will show how this is handled.) The
numbers we get will be called “counts” or “observed counts”.</p>
<p>When we have our observed counts in hand, software will calculate the
counts we should <em>expect</em> to see, <em>if the null hypothesis is
true.</em> We call these the “expected counts.” The software will then
subtract the observed counts from the expected counts and combine these
differences to create a single number that we can use to get a <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value. That single number is called the
<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic. (Note that
<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is a Greek letter, and its
name is “ki”, as in “kite”. The symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> should be pronounced “ki squared,”
but many people pronounce it “ki-square.”)</p>
<p>In this course, software will calculate the <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic for you, but you
need to understand that the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>
test statistic compares the observed counts to the expected counts—that
is, to the counts we should expect to get if the null hypothesis is
true. The larger the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test
statistic is, the smaller the <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value will be. If the <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test statistic is large enough
that the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is less than <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we will conclude that the
observed counts and expected counts are too different for the null
hypothesis to be plausible, and will therefore reject <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. Otherwise, we will fail to reject
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, as always.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, counts are traditionally arranged in a
table called a “contingency table.” One variable is chosen as the “row
variable,” so called because its values are the row headers for the
table. The other variable is called the “column variable,” because its
values are the column headers. Different <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distributions are distinguished by
the number of degrees of freedom, which are determined by the number of
rows and columns in the table:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[df = (\text{number of rows
}-1)(\text{number of columns }-1)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the number of degrees of freedom does not depend on the
number of subjects in the study.</p>

<h2>Reasons for Seeking Chiropractic Care</h2>
<p>A study was conducted to determine why patients seek chiropractic
care<!--<cite>Blum08</cite>-->. Patients were classified based on their
location and their motivation for seeking treatment. Using descriptions
developed by Green and Krueter, patients were asked which of the five
reasons led them to seek chiropractic care
<!--<cite>Blum08,Green99</cite>-->:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wellness</em>: defined as optimizing health among the
self-identified healthy</li>
<li><em>Preventive health</em>: defined as preventing illness among the
self-identified healthy</li>
<li><em>At risk</em>: defined as preventing illness among the currently

<p>The research question was whether people’s motivation for seeking
chiropractic care was independent of their location: Europe, Australia,
or the United States. The hypothesis test used to address this question
was the chi-squared (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>) test
of independence. (Recall that the Greek letter <span
class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is pronounced, “ki” as in
“kite.”)</p>

<li>In the Excel sheet <a

<p>Note: When speaking of the hypotheses in the absence of a context, we
can write them in the form <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}

hypotheses in terms of the context.</p>
<p>If the row and column variable are independent, then no matter which
row you consider, the proportion of observations in each column should
be roughly the same. For example, if motivation for seeking chiropractic
care is independent of location, then the proportion of people who seek
chiropractic care for, say, wellness will be approximately the same in
each row. That is, it will be approximately the same for Australians,
Europeans, and Americans.</p>

<p><strong>Inferential statistics:</strong></p>
<p>The appropriate hypothesis test is the chi-squared test for
independence. The requirement that the expected counts are all at least
5 is met. (Check the picture of the Expected Counts table already shown
above.)</p>
<p>Conduct the hypothesis test:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~~~~~H_0\colon\)</span> Location and the
motivation to visit a chiropractor are independent.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(~~~~~H_a\colon\)</span> Location and the

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>.</p>
<p>The test statistic is: <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2 =
49.743\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(df=8\)</span>.</p>
<!--:*Sketch of the sampling distribution of $\chi^2$: (Draw a right skewed distribution that looks somewhat like an $F$.)-->
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is rounded to .000

class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value you would need to use Excel to
expand the number of decimal places shown: <span

<p>Decision: Reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the
motivation to visit a chiropractor is not independent of the
location.</p>
<!--The following observation really needs to be supported by an appropriate table of percentages or a clustered bar chart, or something.-->
<!--:*Further discussion: <br> People in these three locations evidently have different reasons for seeking chiropractic care. It appears that individuals in Europe are much more likely to seek chiropractic care in the sick role than individuals in the United States and Australia. The Europeans are also less likely to visit a chiropractor for wellness reasons.-->

<p>There may be no general guideline for deciding which variable is the
row variable, but the graphics produced by your software may depend on
this decision. For example, Excel will give you a different clustered
bar chart when you use “Location” as the row variable than when you use
“Motivation” as the row variable. Sometimes, choosing one of the
variables as the row variable makes the clustered bar chart easier to
understand. The bar chart is just below the data entry area in
Excel.</p>

<p>You may wonder why we don’t write “<span
class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> The motivation to visit a
chiropractor depends on location.” Well, couldn’t we say just as easily
that location depends on the motivation to visit a chiropractor? It may
seem a little strange when phrased this way. Let’s use the following
exercises to look briefly at a somewhat less strange example, then
return to this example.</p>

neither depends on the other, but that both depend on something else, in

of distinguishing among the many possible kinds of dependence.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to the exercises you just did, we are not justified in
writing an alternative hypothesis that specifies which variable depends
on which. Could we write “<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span>
Stress level and need to succeed are dependent”? After all,
“independent” and “dependent” are opposites, aren’t they? This may seem
reasonable, but we have to be careful of the technical terms.
Statisticians have gone to some trouble to carefully define
“independent.” They have not defined “dependent.” (As suggested by the
exercises you just did, dependence is complicated, perhaps too
complicated to be able to be defined conveniently.) They use the phrase
“not independent” as the opposite of “independent.” So will we, writing
“<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> Stress level and need to
succeed are not independent.”</p>
<p>Likewise, in the chiropractic care example, we can’t say in the
alternative hypothesis that location depends on motivation, nor that
motivation depends on location, nor that each depends on the other, nor
that both depend on something else, nor that location and motivation are
dependent. Instead, we write “<span
class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> The location and the motivation
for seeking treatment are not independent,” as statisticians do. <!--

## The $\chi^2$ (Chi-squared) Goodness of Fit Test
This test is used to compare the observed counts of two or more categories to the expected counts for those same categories. For example, the Mars company claims that the colors of M&Ms are distributed as follows: 24% Blue, 13% Brown, 16% Green, 20% Orange, 13% Red, 14% Yellow. (see http://joshmadison.com/2007/12/02/mms-color-distribution-analysis/) These are the expected proportions (not counts). In a bag of $200$ M&Ms, the expected number of Blue M&Ms is $48$, the expected number of Brown M&Ms is $26$, etc.

To verify the Mars company claim, you could buy several bags of M&Ms and count the number of each color. These would be the observed counts. The $\chi^2$ (Chi-squared) Goodness of Fit Test can be used to compare the expected counts to the observed counts and decide if they are similar or not.

The test is based on the $\chi^2$ statistic that is defined here:

$\chi^2 = \Sigma \frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}$

The $\chi^2$ statistic can be used to conduct a hypothesis test.

We illustrate this test using a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) study conducted in King County Washington. The research question in this study was, "Do SIDS deaths occur uniformly across all four seasons?" We will conduct this hypothesis test using a level of significance $\alpha = 0.05$. The null hypothesis is that the answer to this question is, "Yes." So the null and alternative hypotheses can be expressed as follows.

$H_0:$ SIDS deaths are equally likely in winter, spring, summer, and fall
$H_a:$ SIDS deaths are not equally likely in winter, spring, summer, and fall

The number if SIDS deaths that occurred during the observation period in each season were: 78 (winter), 71 (spring), 87 (summer), 86 (fall). The total number of deaths is $78 + 71 + 87 + 86 = 322$. So the expected number of SIDS deaths in each season is $322/4 = 80.5$.

Then $\chi^2 = \frac{(78 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(71 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(87 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(86 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} = 2.1$.

The sample data (observed values) and the the expected counts are summarized in this table.

<center>
{| class="basic" style="text-align:center"
! Season || Winter || Spring || Summer || Fall
|-
! Expected Proportion ||  80.5 || 80.5 || 80.5 || 80.5 
|-
! Observed Count || 78 || 71 || 87 || 86
|-
|}
</center>

The degrees of freedom $df$ equals the number of categories minus one or $df = 4 - 1 = 3$. The $P$-value is the probability that $\chi^2$ is greater then the observed value of the test statistic, or $P(\chi^2 > 2.1)$. This probability is the area under the curve to the right of $2.1$ of a $\chi^2$ distribution curve, illustrated here.

insert graphic

In this case, the $P$-value = 0.5519. Since the $P$-value = 0.5519 > 0.05 = $\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of SIDS deaths is different from one season to another.


See - http://wiener.math.csi.cuny.edu/Statistics/R/simpleR/stat013.html


Another example: The letter distribution of the 5 most popular letters in the English language is known to be approximately

<center>
{| class="basic" style="text-align:center"
! Letter || E || T || N || R || O
|-
! Frequency ||  29 || 21 || 17 || 17 || 16 
|-
|}
</center>

That is, when either E, T, N, R, O appear, on average 29 times out of 100 it is an E and not the other 4. This information is useful in cryptography to break some basic secret codes.

We want to test the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis as follows.

$H_0:$ The frequency of E, T, N, R, O is consistent with English
$H_a:$ The frequency of E, T, N, R, O is not consistent with English

A text of  unknown origin is analyzed and the number of E, T, N, R, and O's is counted. The following distribution is found.

<center>
{| class="basic" style="text-align:center"
! Letter || E || T || N || R || O
|-
! Count ||  100 || 110 || 80 || 55 || 14 
|-
|}
</center>

We now do a chi-square goodness of fit hypothesis test to see if the letter frequencies for this text are consistent with the English language or not.

The chi-squared test requires the independence of each letter, which is not quite true in most languages. Even so, this type of analysis reveals valuable insights.

In this case $\chi^2 = 55.3955$, $df = 4$, and the $P$-value = 2.685e-11. Remember, the $P$-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since the $P$-value is effectively 0, it is very unlikely that this text is written in English.

Remark: need to add Excel and SPSS instructions.

<div id="no-confidence-intervals" class="section level3">
<h3>No Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>We do not calculate confidence intervals when working with
contingency tables. Think about it: With three rows and five columns in
the table for the chiropractic care example, there are 15 proportions,
which means there would be 105 pairs of proportions to compare. How
could we possibly interpret a collection of 105 confidence intervals?
Also, if our confidence level is 95%, we would expect that about 5 of
our confidence intervals would not contain the true difference between
proportions, but we wouldn’t know which ones. Rather than take the risks
this would cause, the Statistics culture has agreed not to calculate
confidence intervals for contingency tables.</p>
<!-- TO-DO LIST

## To-do list for the authors of this wiki
- Make sure all the vocabulary is defined.
- Add another example.
- Test of several proportions?
- Goodness-of-fit tests
- Lesson summary
- Add an optional section that shows how the $\chi^2$ statistic is calculated.

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>
hypothesis test</strong> is a test of independence between two
variables. These variables are either associated or they are not.
Therefore, the null and alternative hypotheses are the same for every
test: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{1cl}
H_0: &amp; \text{The (first variable) and the (second variable) are
independent.} \\
H_a: &amp; \text{The (first variable) and the (second variable) are not
independent.}
\end{array}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>degrees of freedom (<span
class="math inline">\(df\)</span>)</strong> for a <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of independence are
calculated using the formula <span
class="math inline">\(df=(\text{number of rows}-1)(\text{number of
columns}-1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In our hypothesis testing for <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> we never conclude that two
variables are <em>dependent</em>. Instead, we say that two variables are
<em>not independent</em>. <br></p></li>
