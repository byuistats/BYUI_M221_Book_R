<h2>The Chi-squared Test of Independence</h2>
<p>The chi-squared test of independence allows us to determine if two different categorical variables are related to each other. Here are some questions that could be answered with a chi-squared test of independence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the education level obtained by your father impact the education level you will obtain in life? (Here education level could be defined to be one of: High School, Associates Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, or Graduate Degree. The two variables we would be comparing would be the child’s education level and their father’s education level.)</li>
<li>Does the marital status of a person (single, married, widowed, or divorced/separated) relate to the overall happiness of that person (very happy, happy, not too happy)?</li>
<li>Does a student’s major (say Business, Nursing, Biology, or Math) have any impact on their ability to get a good paying job (say above $50,000 per year versus below $50,000) after graduating from college?</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these examples, there were two sets of categorical data that were being compared to see if there was any relation between those variables. An important word that will be used in this lesson to talk about variables being related or not is the word <em>independent</em>. Things that <strong>are independent</strong> of each other have absolutely no relation to each other. On the other hand, when things are related to each other, that means that they are <strong>not independent of each other</strong>. Keep this in mind as you read this lesson. Independent means not related, and <em>not independent</em> means <em>related</em>.</p>
<!--

People seek chiropractic care for different reasons. We may want to know if those reasons are different for Europeans than for Americans or Australians. This question can be expressed as "Do reasons for seeking chiropractic care depend on the location in which one lives?"

This question has only two possible answers: "yes" and "no." The answer "no" can be written as "Motivations for seeking chiropractic care and one's location are independent." (The statistical meaning of "independent" is too technical to give here. However, for now, you can think of it as meaning that the two variables are not associated in any way. For example, neither variable depends on the other.) Writing the answer "no" this way allows us to use it as the null hypothesis of a test. We can write the alternative hypothesis by expressing the answer "yes" as "Motivations for seeking chiropractic care and one's location are not independent." (Reasons for wording it this way will be given after you've been through the entire hypothesis test.)

To prepare for the hypothesis test, recall that our hypothesis tests always measure how different two or more things are. For example, in the 2-sample $t$-test, we compare two population means by seeing how different they are. In a test of one proportion, we measure the difference between a sample proportion and a population proportion. Each of these tests requires some information about at least one parameter. That information is given in the null hypothesis of the test, which we've always been able to write with one or more " = " signs, because we've always used numeric parameters.

Unfortunately, we have no parameter we can use to measure the independence of the variables "location" and "motivation". Nevertheless, we have to be able to calculate a $P$-value, and the only approach we have so far is to measure differences between things. "Difference" means "subtraction" in Statistics, and if the measurements are categorical, we cannot subtract them. Therefore, as in the other lessons of this unit, we will count occurrences of each value of each variable to get some numbers. (The example that follows will show how this is handled.) The numbers we get will be called "counts" or "observed counts".

When we have our observed counts in hand, software will calculate the counts we should *expect* to see, *if the null hypothesis is true.* We call these the "expected counts." The software will then subtract the observed counts from the expected counts and combine these differences to create a single number that we can use to get a $P$-value. That single number is called the $\chi^2$ test statistic. (Note that $\chi$ is a Greek letter, and its name is "ki", as in "kite". The symbol $\chi^2$ should be pronounced "ki squared," but many people pronounce it "ki-square.")

In this course, software will calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic for you, but you need to understand that the $\chi^2$ test statistic compares the observed counts to the expected counts---that is, to the counts we should expect to get if the null hypothesis is true. The larger the $\chi^2$ test statistic is, the smaller the $P$-value will be. If the $\chi^2$ test statistic is large enough that the $P$-value is less than $\alpha$, we will conclude that the observed counts and expected counts are too different for the null hypothesis to be plausible, and will therefore reject $H_0$. Otherwise, we will fail to reject $H_0$, as always.

For organizational reasons, counts are traditionally arranged in a table called a "contingency table." One variable is chosen as the "row variable," so called because its values are the row headers for the table. The other variable is called the "column variable," because its values are the column headers. Different $\chi^2$ distributions are distinguished by the number of degrees of freedom, which are determined by the number of rows and columns in the table: 

$$df = (\text{number of rows }-1)(\text{number of columns }-1)$$

Note that the number of degrees of freedom does not depend on the number of subjects in the study.

<p>A <a href="https://drcharlesblum.com/About%20Us/BlumJCCASep2008.pdf">study was conducted</a> to determine why patients in Australia, Europe, and the U.S.A. seek chiropractic care<!--<cite>Blum08</cite>-->. Patients were classified based on their location (Australia, Europe, or the U.S.A.) and their motivation for seeking treatment. Using descriptions developed by Green and Krueter, patients were asked which of the five reasons led them to seek chiropractic care <!--<cite>Blum08,Green99</cite>-->:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wellness</em>: defined as optimizing health among the self-identified healthy</li>
<li><em>Prevention</em>: defined as preventing illness among the self-identified healthy</li>
<li><em>At risk</em>: defined as preventing illness among the currently healthy who are at heightened risk to develop a specific condition</li>
<li><em>Sick role</em>: defined as getting well among those self-perceived as ill with an emphasis on therapist-directed treatment</li>
<li><em>Self care</em>: defined as getting well among those self-perceived as ill favoring the use of self vs. therapist directed strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>The research question was whether people’s motivation for seeking chiropractic care was related to their location: Europe, Australia, or the United States or not. The hypothesis test used to address this question was the chi-squared (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>) test of independence. (Note that the Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is pronounced, “ki” as in “kite.”)</p>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses for this chi-squared test of independence are: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}
H_0\colon &amp; \text{The location and the motivation for seeking treatment are independent} \\
H_a\colon &amp; \text{The location and the motivation for seeking treatment are not independent} \\
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note: When speaking of the hypotheses in the absence of a context, we can write them in the form <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}
H_0\colon &amp; \text{The row variable and the column variable are independent} \\
H_a\colon &amp; \text{The row variable and the column variable are not independent} \\
\end{array}
\]</span> When writing these in the context of a given situation, replace “row variable” and “column variable” by a more descriptive reference.</p>
<p>We will use the level of significance <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>The researchers reported on their data collection procedures with the following statement. “Using an international convenience sample of Sacro-Occipital Technique (SOT) practitioners, 1316 consecutive patients attending 27 different chiropractic clinics in the USA, Europe and Australia completed a one-page survey on intake to assess reason for seeking care. A forced choice response was obtained characterizing the patient’s reason for seeking chiropractic care.”</p>

<p>Notice that the values in the first column of the contingency table are in the first row of its transpose. When a table is transposed, the rows and columns essentially trade roles.</p>
<p>While a table of counts (a contingency table) is helpful in describing the relationship between two categorical variables like <em>location</em> and <em>motivation</em>, a clustered bar chart makes it much easier to visually compare and contrast the observed counts. We can use the contingency table to create a clustered bar chart using the <code>barplot( )</code> command. We will include the following optional commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>beside = TRUE</code> puts the bars side-by-side. Not using <code>beside = TRUE</code> results in a stacked bar chart.</p></li>
<li><p><code>legend.text = TRUE</code> adds a legend to the graph. Sometimes the legend covers the bars, so it is useful in that case to use <code>ylim = c(0, some number)</code> so that the legend is moved off of the bars.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>barplot(contingency_table, beside = TRUE, legend = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lesson19_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It is usually helpful to also examine a bar chart of the transpose of the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>barplot(t(contingency_table), beside = TRUE, legend = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lesson19_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Either plot can be used. They present identical information in different ways. You will probably prefer one of these plots over the other, so use the one you feel best describes the data.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes sense to group the reasons people seek chiropractic care together for each country. The second boxplot seems to be more effective as presenting the information in this case.</p>
<p>Notice that the legend covers part of the bars in this plot. If we increase the length of the y-axis to 450 (instead of the default value), the legend no longer covers the bars. This is accomplished with the argument <code>ylim = c(0, 450)</code>, which sets the limits of the y-axis to go from 0 to 450. We can also color the plot by providing enough colors for each of the legend entries. We will use the first plot, which has five legend entries. So, we use the command: <code>col = c("tan3", "brown3", "darkorchid", "steelblue3", "darkolivegreen4")</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>barplot(t(contingency_table), beside = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
        ylim = c(0, 450),  # extend the y-axis from 0 to 450
        col = c(&quot;tan3&quot;, &quot;brown3&quot;, &quot;darkorchid&quot;, &quot;steelblue3&quot;, &quot;darkolivegreen4&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>The predominant motivation that people choose to seek chiropractic care in any region is for <em>Self Care</em>. The second-most common reason differs across the three regions. For Australia, it is <em>At Risk</em>. For Europe, it is <em>Sick Role</em>, and for the United States, it is <em>Wellness</em>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step4.png"></p>
<p>Our objective is to determine if the reasons people seek chiropractic care is proportionally the same for each of the three locations. In other words, we want to know if people’s motivation for seeking chiropractic care is independent of their location.</p>
<p>The barcharts for the three regions do not look the same. This suggests that the motivation to seek chiropractic care is not independent of the region. However, before drawing a conclusion it is important to conduct the chi-squared test of independence. The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value from this test will help us know if there are statistically significant differences in the ratios across the groups. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, then <em>motivation</em> and <em>location</em> are independent (i.e., not related). So any patterns we are seeing in the bar plot can be attributed to random chance. However, if we reject the null hypothesis then we can claim that <em>motivation</em> and <em>location</em> are <strong>not independent</strong> (meaning the proportions of the reasons people seek care is different in the three locations). We can then draw our final conclusions regarding the patterns observed in the side-by-side bar plots.</p>

<p>People in Europe, Australia, and the United States evidently have different reasons for seeking chiropractic care. It appears that individuals in Europe are much more likely to seek chiropractic care in the sick role than individuals in the United States and Australia. The Europeans are also less likely to visit a chiropractor for wellness reasons.</p>

<p>There may be no general guideline for deciding which variable is the row variable, but the graphics produced by your software may depend on this decision. For example, R will give you a different clustered bar chart when you use “Location” as the row variable than when you use “Motivation” as the row variable. Sometimes, choosing one of the variables as the row variable makes the clustered bar chart easier to understand.</p>

<div id="why-h_a-is-worded-as-it-is" class="section level3">
<h3>Why <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> is Worded As It Is</h3>
<p>Recall that in the chiropractic care example, the hypotheses for the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of independence were</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{1cl}

\]</span></p>
<p>You may wonder why we don’t write “<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> The motivation to visit a chiropractor depends on location.” Well, couldn’t we say just as easily that location depends on the motivation to visit a chiropractor? It may seem a little strange when phrased this way. Let’s use the following exercises to look briefly at a somewhat less strange example, then return to this example.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>According to the exercises you just did, we are not justified in writing an alternative hypothesis that specifies which variable depends on which. Could we write “<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> Stress level and need to succeed are dependent”? After all, “independent” and “dependent” are opposites, aren’t they? This may seem reasonable, but we have to be careful of the technical terms. Statisticians have gone to some trouble to carefully define “independent.” They have not defined “dependent.” (As suggested by the exercises you just did, dependence is complicated, perhaps too complicated to be able to be defined conveniently.) They use the phrase “not independent” as the opposite of “independent.” So will we, writing “<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> Stress level and need to succeed are not independent.”</p>
<p>Likewise, in the chiropractic care example, we can’t say in the alternative hypothesis that location depends on motivation, nor that motivation depends on location, nor that each depends on the other, nor that both depend on something else, nor that location and motivation are dependent. Instead, we write “<span class="math inline">\(H_a\colon\)</span> The location and the motivation for seeking treatment are not independent,” as statisticians do. <!--

## The $\chi^2$ (Chi-squared) Goodness of Fit Test
This test is used to compare the observed counts of two or more categories to the expected counts for those same categories. For example, the Mars company claims that the colors of M&Ms are distributed as follows: 24% Blue, 13% Brown, 16% Green, 20% tan3, 13% Red, 14% Yellow. (see http://joshmadison.com/2007/12/02/mms-color-distribution-analysis/) These are the expected proportions (not counts). In a bag of $200$ M&Ms, the expected number of Blue M&Ms is $48$, the expected number of Brown M&Ms is $26$, etc.

To verify the Mars company claim, you could buy several bags of M&Ms and count the number of each color. These would be the observed counts. The $\chi^2$ (Chi-squared) Goodness of Fit Test can be used to compare the expected counts to the observed counts and decide if they are similar or not.

The test is based on the $\chi^2$ statistic that is defined here:

$\chi^2 = \Sigma \frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}$

The $\chi^2$ statistic can be used to conduct a hypothesis test.

We illustrate this test using a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) study conducted in King County Washington. The research question in this study was, "Do SIDS deaths occur uniformly across all four seasons?" We will conduct this hypothesis test using a level of significance $\alpha = 0.05$. The null hypothesis is that the answer to this question is, "Yes." So the null and alternative hypotheses can be expressed as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{1cl}
H_0: & \text{SIDS deaths are equally likely in winter, spring, summer, and fall.} \\
H_a: & \text{SIDS deaths are not equally likely in winter, spring, summer, and fall}
\end{array}
$$

The number if SIDS deaths that occurred during the observation period in each season were: 78 (winter), 71 (spring), 87 (summer), 86 (fall). The total number of deaths is $78 + 71 + 87 + 86 = 322$. So the expected number of SIDS deaths in each season is $322/4 = 80.5$.

Then $\chi^2 = \frac{(78 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(71 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(87 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} + \frac{(86 - 80.5)^2}{80.5} = 2.1$.

The sample data (observed values) and the the expected counts are summarized in this table.

<center>
{| class = "basic" style = "text-align:center"
! Season || Winter || Spring || Summer || Fall
|-
! Expected Proportion ||  80.5 || 80.5 || 80.5 || 80.5 
|-
! Observed Count || 78 || 71 || 87 || 86
|-
|}
</center>

The degrees of freedom $df$ equals the number of categories minus one or $df = 4 - 1 = 3$. The $P$-value is the probability that $\chi^2$ is greater then the observed value of the test statistic, or $P(\chi^2 > 2.1)$. This probability is the area under the curve to the right of $2.1$ of a $\chi^2$ distribution curve, illustrated here.

insert graphic

In this case, the $P$-value = 0.5519. Since the $P$-value = 0.5519 > 0.05 = $\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of SIDS deaths is different from one season to another.


See - http://wiener.math.csi.cuny.edu/Statistics/R/simpleR/stat013.html


Another example: The letter distribution of the 5 most popular letters in the English language is known to be approximately

<center>
{| class = "basic" style = "text-align:center"
! Letter || E || T || N || R || O
|-
! Frequency ||  29 || 21 || 17 || 17 || 16 
|-
|}
</center>

That is, when either E, T, N, R, O appear, on average 29 times out of 100 it is an E and not the other 4. This information is useful in cryptography to break some basic secret codes.

We want to test the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis as follows.

$H_0:$ The frequency of E, T, N, R, O is consistent with English
$H_a:$ The frequency of E, T, N, R, O is not consistent with English

A text of  unknown origin is analyzed and the number of E, T, N, R, and O's is counted. The following distribution is found.

<center>
{| class = "basic" style = "text-align:center"
! Letter || E || T || N || R || O
|-
! Count ||  100 || 110 || 80 || 55 || 14 
|-
|}
</center>

We now do a chi-square goodness of fit hypothesis test to see if the letter frequencies for this text are consistent with the English language or not.

The chi-squared test requires the independence of each letter, which is not quite true in most languages. Even so, this type of analysis reveals valuable insights.

In this case $\chi^2 = 55.3955$, $df = 4$, and the $P$-value = 2.685e-11. Remember, the $P$-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since the $P$-value is effectively 0, it is very unlikely that this text is written in English.

Remark: need to add Excel and SPSS instructions.

<h3>No Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>We do not calculate confidence intervals when working with contingency tables. Think about it: With three rows and five columns in the table for the chiropractic care example, there are 15 proportions. It can be shown that if we compare these two at a time, there would be 105 pairs to compare. How could we possibly interpret a collection of 105 confidence intervals? Also, if our confidence level is 95%, we would expect that about 5 of our confidence intervals would not contain the true difference between proportions, but we wouldn’t know which ones. Rather than take the risks this would cause, statisticians do not to calculate confidence intervals for contingency tables.</p>

<div class="Summary">
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong><span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> hypothesis test</strong> is a test of independence between two variables. These variables are either associated or they are not. Therefore, the null and alternative hypotheses are the same for every test: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{1cl}
H_0: &amp; \text{The (first variable) and the (second variable) are independent} \\
H_a: &amp; \text{The (first variable) and the (second variable) are not independent}
\end{array}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>degrees of freedom (<span class="math inline">\(df\)</span>)</strong> for a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test of independence are calculated using the formula <span class="math inline">\(df = (\text{number of rows}-1)(\text{number of columns}-1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In our hypothesis testing for <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> we never conclude that two variables are <em>dependent</em>. Instead, we say that two variables are <em>not independent</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>To create a clustered bar chart in R first requires using either <code>cbind( )</code> or <code>rbind( )</code> to create a table of observed counts, and then using <code>barplot(..., beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE)</code> to create the plot. Review this by <a href="Lesson19.html#r-instructions-for-clustered-bar-charts">clicking here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To perform a chi-squared test of independence in R, use the <code>chisq.test( )</code> with your table of observed counts placed inside the function. Review this by <a href="Lesson19.html#r-instructions-for-performing-a%20chi-squared-test-of-independence">clicking here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To check the requirements of a chi-squared test of independence, use the code <code>chisq_test_results$expected</code> where <code>chisq_test_results</code> is the results you saved from your chi-square test. Verify that all expected counts are greater than or equal to 5.</p></li>
