<h2>Welcome to the Course!</h2>
<p>In this course, you will explore important connections between the
academic discipline of Statistics and the world around us. By pondering
these ideas, your understanding of statistics will increase, as will
your knowledge and testimony of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. In
addition, that which you learn in this course will increase your ability
to serve others as a disciple of Jesus Christ and help build Zion.</p>
<p>This course has been designed to help you slowly build up a knowledge
base of ideas and skills. Not all of these ideas and skills will come
easily. It takes a lot of work and practice before some things will even
start to make sense, so you should not be surprised to find that it may
take you a little time to comprehend these ideas. Just be patient. Once
you’re far enough into the course, the ideas will start to come
together, and you will see how much progress you have really made. You
will understand what this course is all about, and you will be glad you
persisted in your efforts to learn.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course covers the following topics as they are applied to
Statistics: graphical representations of data, measures of center and
spread; elementary probability; sampling distributions; correlation and
regression; statistical inference involving means, proportions, and
contingency tables.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="course-learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>In this course, we will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Summarize data numerically and graphically using spreadsheets</li>
<li>Make decisions regarding situations with inherent randomness</li>
<li>Apply probability distributions to investigate questions</li>
<li>Employ confidence intervals in various situations</li>
<li>Implement tests of diverse hypotheses</li>

<div id="how-the-outcomes-will-be-assessed" class="section level3">
<h3>How the Outcomes will Be Assessed</h3>
<p>While you may not be tested on everything you learn in this course,
the instructor will be assessing your mastery of the <strong>Course
Learning Outcomes</strong>. The general types of assessments used to
measure these outcomes may include selected response tests such as
multiple-choice, true-false, matching, and fill-in-the-blank questions.
You may also be asked to complete essays or other writing assignments.
At times, the instructor may assess your performance of a skill, or the
instructor may assess products you create using particular skills. In
addition, the instructor may engage in personal communication with you
to determine how well you understand the course content.</p>

<h3>Keys to Success</h3>

<h4>Five Principles of the Learning Model</h4>
<p>You will experience much deeper learning if you follow the Five
Principles of the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/LearningModel"
target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise Faith</strong>: Exercise faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ as a principle of action and power.</li>
<li><strong>Learn by the Holy Ghost</strong>: Understand that true
teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li><strong>Lay Hold on the Word of God</strong>: Lay hold of the word
of God.</li>
<li><strong>Act for Themselves</strong>: Act for yourself and accept
responsibility for learning and teaching.</li>
<li><strong>Love, Serve, and Teach One Another</strong>: Love, serve,
and teach other students in your classes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="three-process-steps-of-the-learning-model"
class="section level4">
<h4>Three Process Steps of the Learning Model</h4>
<p>You will learn more in less time if you follow the Three Process
Steps of the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/LearningModel"
target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare</strong>: This involves (a) spiritual preparation,
(b) individual preparation, and (c) group preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Teach One Another</strong>: You should (a) be on time, (b)
pray together, and (c) actively engage with other students.</li>
<li><strong>Ponder/Prove</strong>: You should (a) ponder what you have
learned, (b) record your learning, and (c) pursue unanswered questions
and discuss what you learn with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel confused or have questions about anything in the lesson,
take immediate action (Exercise Faith; Act for Themselves) and talk with
your classmates, the teaching assistant, or the instructor (Love, Serve,
and Teach One Another).</p>
<p><strong>Teach One Another</strong></p>
<p>At BYU-Idaho, an “A” student will demonstrate “diligent application
of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other
students” (BYU-Idaho Catalog). In this class, you will have the
opportunity to work with other students.</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants 84:106 states, “And if any man among you be
strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he
may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.” In the
spirit of this revelation, you will have the opportunity to help others
in the class when you have developed an understanding of a principle.
Likewise, you will be able to receive help from others (peers, tutors,
TA, and your instructor) when you are still working to understand
concepts.</p>
<p>In a spirit of love and service, please reach out to others. You are
not graded on a curve. If someone else does well, it does not affect you
adversely. Research has shown that students who help other students to
understand the material gain a much deeper grasp on the concepts of the
course. Please take opportunities to help your peers succeed.</p>

<div id="course-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course consists of 24 lessons. They are presented in a topical
order in which concepts and skills learned in the earlier lessons
provide the requisite knowledge to succeed in later lessons. If the
general order of the lessons doesn’t make sense at first, don’t worry.
It will all come together in the end, and you’ll see the reasoning
behind why the lessons have been presented in this particular order.</p>
<p>Your main goal as a student will be to complete all of the learning
activities within each lesson by their due dates every week. These
activities follow a consistent weekly schedule, and it will be up to you
to make sure that you keep on pace with all your assignments. These
weekly activities may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading assigned texts or viewing presentations.</li>
<li>Taking quizzes.</li>
<li>Participating in group discussions and assignments with other class
members.</li>
<li>Writing papers and/or developing presentations.</li>
<li>Participating in meetings with the instructor, teaching assistants,
and other students.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these activities, the due dates will fall on the same
time each week. This will make it easier for you to plan out your weekly
study schedule. However, there may be a need to make adjustments to the
schedule from time to time. If in doubt, refer to the due dates your
instructor has posted in I-learn.</p>
<p>You should create a study schedule that will keep you on pace
throughout the semester. This is a rigorous course with a lot of subject
matter to cover, and it can be extremely difficult to recover if you
fall too far behind in your work. So, please make every effort to study
on a regular basis and get your work turned in on time.</p>
<p>The lessons in this course have a similar structure and contain
similar basic elements. A typical week consists of two lessons. Each
lesson will consist of a reading assignment, a reading/preparation quiz,
and a homework quiz.</p>
<p>The structure of this course fully integrates the BYU-Idaho Learning
model with a mixture of preparation activities, teach-one-another
activities, and ponder-and-prove activities.</p>

<h2>Probability</h2>
<p>Probability is a way of numerically quantifying how likely an event
is to happen or not happen. The following historical account
demonstrates this idea and shows how fractions (like 1/2 or 3/4) or
percentages (like 50% or 75%) can be used to represent
probabilities.</p>

<h3>Christopher Columbus’ First Voyage</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Columbus_taking_possession_of_the_new_country.jpg"></p>
<p>On August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain for his intended
destination: the Indies (Caso, Adolph 1990). He was on the Santa Maria,
which had a crew of approximately 41 men (“Cristobal colon” 1991;
“Christopher Columbus”). Several other men were aboard the Nina and the
Pinta (“Cristobal colon” 1991). On October 12, he landed on an island in
the Bahamas he called San Salvador.</p>
<p>The return trip was not without challenges. The Santa Maria ran
aground on Christmas Day, 1492, and was abandoned on the island we now
call Hispaniola (home to Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Following
this incident, Columbus sailed for Spain. Severe storms made the journey
difficult. A particularly bad storm on February 14, 1493 made the crew
fear for their lives. By morning, the storm was even worse!</p>
<p>Recognizing his dependence upon God, Columbus ordered that a
pilgrimage should be made to a particular shrine upon their safe arrival
in Spain. He decided that they would use random chance to determine who
would make the pilgrimage. They took one chick pea for each man on
board. A knife was used to mark one of the chick peas with a cross. The
chick peas were placed in a hat and shaken up. Each man was to draw a
chick pea, and the one who had the cross would make the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>“The first who put in his hand was [Columbus,] and he drew out the
bean with a cross, so the lot fell on him; and he was bound to go on the
pilgrimage and fulfil the vow” (Caso, Adolph 1990).</p>

<p><strong>Additional Drawings</strong><br></p>
<p>After the drawing in which Pedro de Villa was chosen to make a
pilgrimage, two additional drawings were held. In both cases, Columbus
drew out the marked chick pea (Caso, Adolph 1990). In all, Christopher
Columbus drew the marked chick pea in three of the four drawings. It can
be shown that the probability that this would occur due to chance is
very small: 0.0000566.

<p><strong>Bonus material. Read only if you are interested.</strong></p>
<p>This calculation is more involved than the calculations you will be
required to make in this course this semester. But if you are still
interested, read on.</p>
<p>In each individual drawing, there was a 1/41 chance of Columbus
getting the marked chick pea. Similarly, there was a 40/41 chance of not
getting it. Since there were four drawings total, and the goal is to
measure the probability of “three of those drawings” resulting in
Columbus getting the marked chick pea, it becomes important to think
about all of the orders in which Columbus could have gotten 3 out of
4.</p>

<p>In each of the above cases, notice that Columbus <em>would have</em>
gotten the marked chick pea a total of 3 out of 4 times. So, this tells
us there are four diffent ways to get the chick pea 3 out of 4
times.</p>
<p>The probability of what actually happened to Columbus <em>in the
order in which it happened</em> would be computed by multiplying the
individual probabilities of each drawing together.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{40}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41}
\approx 0.00001415548
\]</span></p>
<p>But then, we must also add to this the other “possible” scenarios
that would also lead to getting the chick pea 3 out of 4 times, but as
shown below, because multiplication is commutative (the order doesn’t
matter) these “different” situations result in the same probability as
the first.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{40}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41}
\approx 0.00001415548
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{40}{41}
\approx 0.00001415548
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \frac{40}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41} \cdot \frac{1}{41}
\approx 0.00001415548
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, all that is needed is to multiply the first probability of
roughly 0.00001415548 by 4 to get <span
class="math inline">\(0.00001415548 \cdot 4 =
0.00005662192\)</span>.</p>

<p>To put some perspective on this, a high school athlete in the United
States is over 26 times more likely to play professional sports than
Columbus was to draw the three marked peas! (Fields, Mike 2008) Consider
how you might explain the occurrence of this extremely unlikely event.
(While no response is required of you right now, this kind of question
will be very important later, so take a little time to ponder it.) In
fact, it is worth restating the question, “How might you explain the
occurrence of this extremely unlikely event?”</p>

<p>In this course we are interested in experiments where the outcomes of
the experiment are uncertain, yet they follow a pattern or
<em>probabilitiy distribution.</em> As you read in the above questions
and answers, these probability distributions follow three rules.</p>
<div class="Emphasis">
<p>  <strong>The three rules of probability are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 1</strong>: The probability of an event <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a number between 0 and 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 \leq P(X) \leq 1\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 2</strong>: If you list all the outcomes of an
experiment (such as rolling a die) the probability that one of these
outcomes will occur is 1. In other words, the sum of the probabilities
of all the possible outcomes of any experiment is 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum P(X) = 1\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 3</strong>: (Complement Rule) The probability that an
event <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will not occur is 1 minus
the probability that it will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{not}~X) = 1 - P(X)\]</span></p>

of the first two rules.</p>

<p>Informally, a distribution can be thought of as being “all the
possible outcomes of an experiment and how often they occur.”</p>
</div>
<div id="randomness" class="section level3">
<h3>Randomness</h3>
<p>A BYU-Idaho student was overhead saying, “I went shopping and bought
some <em>random</em> items.” Did the person actually take a random
sample of the items at the store? Did they write all the items down and
randomly select the items for purchase? Of course not!</p>
<p>What did the student mean? That the items they bought seemed
unrelated. When we consciously or subconsciously choose a sample, it is
not random.</p>
<p>So, what does it mean to be random? When something is random, it is
not just haphazard, with no pattern. A random process follows a very
distinct pattern over time—the distribution of its outcomes. For
example, if you roll a die thousands of times, about one-sixth of the
time you will roll a four. This is a very clear pattern, or part of a
pattern. The entire pattern (or, the entire distribution) is that each
number on the die is rolled about one-sixth of the time.</p>
<p>But there’s something different about the patterns followed by random
processes than other kinds of patterns. Other kinds of patterns can be
very predictable, such as a color pattern of the red, yellow, blue, red,
yellow, blue, and so on. If you’re following this pattern and happen to
see yellow, you know the next color will be blue. By contrast, you never
know what you will get on the next roll of a six-sided die. You
<em>do</em> know that in the long run you will roll fours about
one-sixth of the time.</p>
<p>When something is random, we can be sure that it follows a long-term
pattern. This long-term pattern is called its <em>probability
distribution</em>. However, what makes “randomness” interesting is that
despite knowing the long-term pattern, or how often something will occur
over time, we still never know what the outcome of the <em>next</em>
experiment will be.</p>

<p>To install the statistical analysis program <strong>RStudio</strong>
you will first need to install a piece of software called
<strong>R</strong>. Funny name, right? (There was originally a software
called “S” for statistics, and then “R” was invented later on. Part of
the reason they used “R” was to claim that “R” was a “leap ahead” of
“S.”)</p>

<p>Once that download finishes, open the resulting file. It should look
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/installingR_step1.png" width="500"></p>
<p>Click “Continue” or “Okay” or “Accept” for all of the several various
windows that will appear. Once the installation is complete you should
get a window like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/installingR_step8.png" width="500"></p>
<p>Now that R is properly installed on your computer, we need to install
RStudio. RStudio is an app that runs R inside of it and provides you
with many other tools that go way beyond what R can do. This is why R
must be installed first, so that RStudio can use it. You will never need
to open R yourself. Just use RStudio. But without R, RStudio won’t work
properly.</p>

<p>Once the RStudio installer downloads, open the resulting file. A
window like this should appear:</p>
<p><img src="Images/rstudio_setup.png" width="500"></p>
<p>Again, work through the installation process, agreeing with all the
defaults and terms of conditions.</p>
<p>Once the installation finishes you can use your computer’s search bar
to search for “RStudio” in your apps. It will have an icon like this:
<img src="Images/RStudio_logo.png" width="30">.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully opened RStudio it should look like
this:</p>

<p><br> <strong>Check R and RStudio have been installed
correctly</strong> by calculating the average of some data values. To do
this, follow these steps: <br /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy and paste the following text into the lower left corner of
the RStudio screen next to the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. You will find
this symbol below the word Console.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>mydata &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
mean(mydata)</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Then press Return. The first line of code stores the six numbers in
a variable called <code>mydata</code>. The second line tells R to
compute the average (or mean) of the numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). You
should see the following result:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.333333</code></pre>

<li><p>In this class you will use the online textbook that has been
written for you by your statistics teachers. All of the assignments and
quizzes will be based on the readings, so study it well.</p></li>
<li><p>Most weeks will cover two lessons</p></li>
<li><p>By doing the work, staying on schedule, and living the Honor Code
you <em>will</em> succeed in this class!</p></li>
<li><p>The three <strong>rules of probability</strong> are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A probability is a number between 0 and 1. <span
class="math display">\[0 \leq P(X) \leq 1\]</span></li>
<li>If you list all the outcomes of a probability experiment (such as
rolling a die) the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is
1. In other words, the sum of the probabilities in any probability is 1.
<span class="math display">\[\sum P(X) = 1\]</span></li>
<li>The probability that an outcome will not occur is 1 minus the
probability that it will occur. <span
class="math display">\[P(\text{not}~X) = 1 - P(X)\]</span></li>
