<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This lesson introduces three important concepts of statistical
theory:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean</li>
<li>The Central Limit Theorem</li>
<li>The Law of Large Numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, a single sample of data is obtained from a population of
interest in order to <em>make inference</em> about the entire
population. However, even though only one sample is obtained, there are
many, many random samples that are <em>possible</em> to obtain from a
population. Understanding what <em>could happen</em> from a theoretical
perspective is important in knowing how to use the single sample of data
appropriately when making inference about a population. Let’s look at an
example.</p>
</div>
<div id="case-study-ddts-negative-impact-on-pregnant-women"
class="section level2">
<h2>Case Study: DDT’s Negative Impact on Pregnant Women</h2>
<p><img src = "Images/Cropduster_spraying_pesticides.jpg"></p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design the Study</strong></p>
<p>Mosquitoes and other biting insects carry malaria. In an attempt to
curb the spread of malaria and save lives, the pesticide DDT was used
for many years to control the insect population, even indoors.
Unfortunately, this pesticide does not break down quickly in nature and
is very harmful to humans.</p>
<p>A metabolite of DDT (called DDE) is also very dangerous. A metabolite
is the byproduct that occurs when our body breaks down a substance. When
DDT is broken down in humans, DDE is one of the metabolites that remains
from the original DDT.</p>
<p>Scientists have shown that DDT and its metabolites cause reproductive
problems in humans and other animals. When a pregnant woman has a
contamination level as low as 10 mg/kg of DDE in her body, she is much
more likely to give birth to an underweight baby or to deliver
prematurely (Wells &amp; Leonard, 2006).</p>
<p>A study of 45 pregnant women who have been exposed to DDT / DDE was
conducted using a convenience sample (Bornman, MS. 2005). Global
Solutions Unlimited (GSU) will analyze the data from this study. These
data will be used to assess the prevalence of DDT in drinking water.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Collect Data</strong></p>
<p>After selecting specific women to be sampled, researchers measured
the level of DDE contamination for each of these randomly selected
women.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step3.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Describe the Data</strong></p>
<p>The researchers computed the mean and standard deviation of the
observed levels of exposure for the 45 women. They found the mean
observed contamination level was 24.75 mg/kg, and the highest level of
contamination was 419.91 mg/kg! (Bornman, MS. 2005)</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step4.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make Inferences</strong></p>
<p>The researchers only obtained one sample mean, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>. They do not get to see any other
data. They only had enough time, funding, and other resources to survey
the 45 women in their sample. An important question to ask at this point
is whether or not the results of this sample show evidence that the mean
DDE contamination in the full population of South American women was
greater than 10 mg/kg.</p>
<p>If the researchers had selected a different random sample of pregnant
women, the mean contamination of the women in the sample would
undoubtedly be different. However, this did not happen. The researchers
do not get to see the contamination levels for any other women. They
only collected this one sample.</p>
<p>This is how research is often conducted…repeated samples are not
typically drawn, so we do not get to know what might have happened had
we gathered data from a different sample. Were it not for statistical
theory, the results from our single sample would essentially be
worthless. But the good news is that statistical theory provides us with
just the tools we need to be able to use our single sample in a
meaningful way to make inference about the full population.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step5.png"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Take Action</strong></p>
<p>In this study, there was a lot of evidence that the mean DDE
contamination in the pregnant women was greater than 10 mg/kg. The
probability of the DDE contamination in the women’s bodies exceeding 10
mg/kg (if there were no contamination) is approximately 0.02. This
probability is low enough that there is reason for concern.
Statistically speaking, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the
levels of DDE contamination are too high among South African women.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-to-sampling-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to Sampling Distributions</h2>
<p>Now let’s take a look behind the scenes to explore how statistical
theory is used to create what is called a <em>sampling distribution of
the sample mean.</em> This distribution becomes the key in making
inference about a full population based on just the limited information
in a single sample of data. To come to understand just what the phrase
“sampling distribution of a sample mean” is describing, there are three
items worth remembering.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, recall that a <em>distribution</em> is a graph (like a
histogram) showing how data is spread out. In <a
href="Lesson03.html">Lesson 3</a> we considered three main types of
distributions of data:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/Lesson_2_Activity_2-3.JPG" width = 130%></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Second, recall that the sample mean is denoted by the symbol
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>. The mean is computed by
adding up all of the values in the sample and dividing by the number of
things in the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, recall that the true mean of the full population is
denoted by the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and that
the standard deviation of the population is denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with those reminders in place, you will need to <strong>work
through the following tutorial</strong> to come to understand the idea
of a “sampling distribution of a sample mean.”</p>
<div id="a-tutorial-on-sampling-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>A Tutorial on Sampling Distributions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open <a
href="http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html">this
applet</a> and click on “Begin”<br />
<a href = "http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html"><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step1.png" width = 400px;></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure your internet browser window is
wide enough to show all of the applet controls.</p></li>
</ul>
<table>
<tr>
<td style="color:red;">
Internet browser window is too small. (Bad)
</td>
<td style="color:green;">
Internet browser window large enough to see all controls. (Good)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step2a.png" width = 300px;>
</td>
<td>
<img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step2b.png" width = 400px;>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the “Animated” button on the right of
the applet. It will drop down a single random sample of N = 5 data
points (i.e., black boxes) from the parent population. (Because the
sample is random, your sample will possibly land in a different place
than what is shown here.)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step3.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Notice that a little blue box dropped down
from your “Sample Data” of N = 5 black boxes (data points). This little
blue box represents the mean, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, of your single sample of N = 5
boxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step4.png"></p>
<p>Now is where things get interesting. In real life, all we would use
is the single sample of N = 5 values and the sample mean, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, to make inferece (make our
guess) about the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, of the
full population. (The full population in this applet is shown in the top
black graph.) However, the purpose of this applet is to allow us to
explore how our answer would change if we used a different sample of N =
5 data points. A different sample will result in a different sample mean
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>. So the question is, what
values are possible for the sample mean? Are some values of the sample
mean more likely than others?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> <strong>Click the Animated</strong> button
several more times. Each time, watch how a new random sample of N = 5
data points is generated for the “Sample Data” graph, and then the mean
of that sample is plotted in the bottom “Distribution of Means, N = 5”
graph. The following image shows the results after clicking the
“Animated” button 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step5.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, let’s get the number of sample means
(blue boxes) up to a million! To save time, there are buttons below the
“Animated” button labeled “5”, “10,000”, and “100,000”. Clicking the
“100,000” button 10 times will quickly get us up to one million sample
means. Keep in mind that by doing this, you are essentially clicking the
“Animated” button 1,000,000 times! (To actually click the “Animated”
button one million times it would take you roughly 26 days of constantly
clicking the “Animated” button over and over again!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now study the arrows in the image below. As you do, you should notice
that to the left of the “Distribution of Means, N = 5” graph, the mean
of the distribution of sample means (which is equal to 16) and standard
deviation of the distribution of sample means (which is equal to 2.24)
are given. Compare these values to the mean and standard deviation shown
for the Parent Population graph.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step6.png"></p>
<p>Hopefully you noticed that the “mean of the distribution of means” is
equal to the “mean of the population.” The mean of the means is the
mean! Let’s say that again. The <em>mean of all possible sample means is
equal to the mean of the population.</em> In short, the mean of the
means is the mean. As for the standard deviation though, notice that the
“standard deviation of the sample means” is smaller than the “standard
deviation of the population.” It turns out that these two results hold
true for any parent population and any sample size. There are two
mathematical formulas that summarize these truths.</p>
<div class="myemphasis">
<p><strong>The Mean of the Distribution of the Sample Mean</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\underbrace{\mu_{\bar{x}}}_\text{The mean of the distribution of the
sample mean} = \underbrace{\mu}_\text{The mean of the population}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>The Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution of the

<p><span class="math display">\[
\underbrace{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}_\text{The st. dev. of the sample means} =
\frac{\overbrace{\sigma}^\text{The st. dev. of the

\]</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Shape of the Sampling Distribution of the Sample
Mean</strong></p>
<p>Notice that the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean
is normal in the experiment we just performed in the above applet. This
is an important result because (as you will see in <a
href="Lesson07.html">Lesson 7</a>) we will be able to use the Normal
Probability Applet to make probability calculations about sample means
whenever the sampling distribution of the sample mean is normal.
Unfortunately, there are some situations where the sampling distribution
of the sample mean is not normal. This ruins our ability to make
inference about the parent population. Let’s look at one such
situation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Press the [Clear Lower 3] button. This will
erase your data and reset the applet. Then, use the drop-down menu below
the [Clear Lower 3] button to <strong>change</strong> the distribution
from a <strong>normal distribution</strong> to a <strong>skewed
distribution</strong>. The applet should now show a right-skewed
distribution for the “Parent Population” data graph.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step7.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Change the sample size to a very small
sample size by selecting “N = 2”. Then press the “Animated” button a few
times to get a feel for what a sample of N = 2 data points looks like
from this right-skewed population.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step8.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Then, get a million such samples by
clicking the “100,000” button ten times. You should get something
similar to what is shown below. (Notice that the mean of the
“Distribution of Means” is still equal to the mean of the “Parent
population.” Also note that the standard deviation of the “Distribution
of Means” is equal to <span class="math inline">\(6.22/\sqrt(2) =
4.40\)</span>, which is <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma/\sqrt(n)\)</span>, as shown by our formula
stated previously for the “Standard deviation of the Sample
Means.”)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src = "Images/samplingDistTutorial_Step9.png"></p>
<p>However, when it comes to the shape of the distribution of means, you
should notice that the blue graph showing the “Distribution of Means, N
= 2” is not normally distributed. Like the distribution of the “Parent
population” it is also right-skewed. This is problematic when it comes
to trying to perform statistical analysis on a small sample (like N = 2)
from a population of skewed data because we can’t use the normal
probability applet for things that are skewed. But there is a beautiful
promise in statistical theory called the <strong>Central Limit
Theorem</strong> that solves this problem. All we need is a larger
sample size and the skewed distribution of means will magically “go
away.” We will state this result formally in a moment. For now, see it
happen yourself by doing the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Change the sample size from “N = 2” (a
small sample) to “N = 25” (a much larger sample). Then, click the
“Animated” button a few times to get a feel for what is happening.
Finally, click the “100,000” button ten times to get a million sample
means from a million different samples of “N = 25” data points in each
sample. Look at how beautifully normal the distribution of sample means
(the blue graph) is becoming! The “Parent population” data is still
skewed. Even the “Sample Data” is still skewed. But the “Distribution of
Means” is becoming normal! This is the <strong>Central Limit
Theorem</strong> in action.</li>

<h3>What is the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean?</h3>
<p>The sampling distribution of the sample mean is the set of all
possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> that
could occur. You have seen several examples of sampling distributions as
you have plotted many means in the simulations and observed the
approximately normal distribution that occurs. In the real world, you
only observe <em>your</em> sample mean. You do not get to view the
distribution. However, the fact that you sample randomly means that you
could easily have drawn a different sample and had a different sample
mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>. There are
<em>many</em> possible sample means!</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="the-central-limit-theorem" class="section level2">
<h2>The Central Limit Theorem</h2>
<div class="myemphasis">
<p><strong>The Central Limit Theorem</strong> states that the sampling
distribution of the sample mean will be <em>approximately normal</em> if
the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of a sample is
sufficiently large.</p>
</div>
<p>In the study of DDE levels in the South African women, we never saw
the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We only observed one
sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>. Even though we
do not get to see the sampling distribution of all possible sample
means, since the sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n =
45\)</span>) was large, we can be assured that the sample mean <span
class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> can be considered as one drawn
from a normally distributed population of possible sample means. This
allows us to make powerful statistical inference about the data as you
will learn in <a href="Lesson07.html">Lesson 7</a>.</p>
<p>You have observed in the simulations that if the sample size is
large, the random variable <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>
will be approximately normally distributed. In other words, the sampling
distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the
sample size is sufficiently large. This important result is called the
<strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong>. This is arguably the most
important concept in all of Statistics.</p>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem works for every population where the
standard deviation is defined (is not infinite). In other words, it will
work for any distribution you find in the real world.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="when-is-bar-x-normal" class="section level3">
<h3>When is <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> Normal?</h3>
<p>How many observations are required so that the Central Limit Theorem
will assure that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be
approximately normal? The answer is, “it depends.”</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parent population is normal, then the sampling distribution
of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> will always be normally
distributed, no matter how many observations are selected.</li>
<li>If the parent population is not normal, then the sampling
distribution <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> will be
approximately normally distributed, if the sample size is large enough.
<ul>
<li>If the parent population is almost normal (e.g. mound-shaped and
nearly symmetrical), then a sample of size n = 5 will probably be
sufficient to assure that <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>
will be approximately normally distributed.</li>
<li>If the parent population is heavily skewed, then it will require a
larger sample size to be assured that <span class="math inline">\(\bar
x\)</span> will be normally distributed. For most moderately skewed
distributions, a sample size of around 30 is traditionally thought to be
sufficiently large to assure that <span class="math inline">\(\bar
x\)</span> will be approximately normally distributed. This is not a
definitive number but is a rule of thumb.</li>
<li>For tremendously skewed distributions (e.g., the distribution of
lottery payouts), a much larger sample will be required before the
sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. This
may require billions of observations. Simulation can be used to
determine if a particular sample size is sufficient. For this course, if
the sample size is at least 30, we will conclude that the sampling
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> will be
approximately normal.</li>

<p>The result you have discovered in the previous two questions is
called the Law of Large Numbers. The Law of Large Numbers states that if

to the population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. This
happens because the standard deviation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma / \sqrt{n}\)</span> will get smaller as the
sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases.</p>
<p>Notice that this is very different from the Central Limit Theorem.
The Central Limit Theorem states that if the sample size is large that
<span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span> will be approximately

<h2>Review of Key Concepts</h2>
<p>In order to “do statistics” we need to compute probabilities. This
requires we know the distribution of the population of interest. The
most important distributions in this course are the normal
distributions, which were introduced in <a href="Lesson05.html">Lesson
5</a>. In this lesson, we are interested in another very important
distribution: the distribution of all the sample means, <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>. In order to do statistics with
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> we need the sampling
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> to be
normal. There are two situations when the distribution of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is guaranteed to be normal (or at
least very close to normal). They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parent population is normal, the distribution of the sample
means <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> will be normal, for
every sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Even if the parent population is not normal, the Central Limit
Theorem guarantees that the distribution of the sample mean <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> will be approximately normal if
the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large enough.
<strong>For this course, if</strong> <span class="math inline">\(n \geq
30\)</span>, <strong>we will say the distribution of the sample means
will be approximately normal</strong> (even if the parent population is
not normal).</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\)</span> of the
sample means is the population mean <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.</li>
<li>The standard deviation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\)</span> of the sample means is
the population standard deviation <span
