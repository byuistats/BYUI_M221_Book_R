<h2>Case Study: How Confident are You?</h2>
<div style="float:right;padding:10px;width = 80%;">
<p><img src = "Images/Testtaking-exam.jpg"></p>
</div>
<p>Think about a time when you walked into an exam, having prepared carefully, <em>knowing</em> that you would do well. On the other hand, have you ever entered an exam feeling unprepared? How have your exam scores compared to your confidence?</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step1.png"></p>
<p>Shane Goodwin and other researchers examined this question. They studied factors that affect a student’s confidence on a multiple-choice mathematics exam<!--<cite>Goodwin09</cite>-->. A group of n = 139 students in an Intermediate Algebra course (MATH 101) at BYU-Idaho participated in the study. As students completed the exam, they were required to both answer each question on the exam as well as rate their confidence for each of their answers being correct on a scale of 1 to 6, where confidence ratings of 1 meant “No Clue” and confidence ratings of 6 meant the student was “Certain” they had entered the correct answer to that question.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence Rating</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Random guess (no clue)</p></li>
<li><p>Very unsure</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhat unsure</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhat sure</p></li>
<li><p>Very sure</p></li>
<li><p>Certain (absolutely sure)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the exam, two values were recorded for each student. First, the final score was computed as a percentage of questions answered correctly for that student. Second, the final confidence rating was computed by taking the average confidence score from all of the confidence scores that the student had recorded for each question. Confidence ratings were not relayed to the instructor, and they did not affect the grade on the exam.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(n = 139\)</span> students from the selected Math 101 course represented a convenience sample of students. They were the students of teachers who elected to have their students participate in this study.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/Step3.png"></p>
</div>
<div id="describing-bivariate-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Describing Bivariate Data</h2>
<p>Two values were computed for each student at the completion of their exam. The first value was the mean confidence rating (possible values ranging from 1 to 6) from each student’s confidence scores they provided for each question. The second value was the actual score the student earned on the exam (out of 100 points possible). The confidence ratings and exam scores are given in the file <a href="./data/math_self_efficacy.xlsx">math_self_efficacy.xlsx</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that we have two quantitative measurements on each participant. We call these data <strong>bivariate data</strong>, since there are two (bi-) quantitative variables that we are considering simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the past, we have summarized quantitative data by computing summary statistics. Here are a couple of statistics computed from these data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean score on the test was 74.7 points.</li>
<li>The mean confidence rating was 4.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these statistics are useful, they do not provide information about the <em>connection</em> between the students’ scores on the exam and their confidence. If a student feels very confident, what do the data tell us about their test score? Do they score higher on the exam than those that feel less confident? We need a new tool to help us relate the values of two quantitative observations. When we have two quantitative measurements on a unit, we have <strong>bivariate data</strong>.</p>
<div id="graphical-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Graphical Summary</h3>
<p>A scatterplot is an excellent way to present the bivariate relationship between two quantitative variables. The scatterplot has a y-axis (the vertical axis) that usually represents the variable we are most interested in studying. The x-axis of the scatterplot uses the other variable to help <em>explain</em> the y-variable. In this case, we will use the x-axis as the confidence rating of each student in order to <em>explain</em> the exam score of each student.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-instructions-for-scatterplots" class="section level3">
<h3>R Instructions for Scatterplots</h3>
<div class="SoftwareHeading">
R Instructions
</div>
<div class="Software">
<p><strong>To create a scatterplot in R</strong> use the <code>plot(...)</code> function with the <code>y-variable</code> placed first, followed by a <code>~</code>, followed by the <code>x-variable</code>.</p>
<p>First, read in the data: <a href="./data/math_self_efficacy.xlsx">math_self_efficacy.xlsx</a>. (<a href="RHelp.html#reading-in-data">Click here</a> for a reminder on how to read in data.) Then, run the code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(math_self_efficacy$score ~ math_self_efficacy$confidence_rating_mean)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Of course, it is good practice to provide some color and better labeling with any plot. To do that, use the options of</p>
<ul>
<li><code>col =</code> a name of a color to specify the color of the points in the graph,</li>
<li><code>pch =</code> a number 1 to 25 to specify the plotting character used for each point in the graph,</li>
<li><code>xlab =</code> to specify in quotations the words to print below the x-axis,</li>
<li><code>ylab =</code> to specify in quotations the words to print next to the y-axis, and</li>
<li><code>main =</code> to specify in quotations the main title of the graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are demonstrated below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(math_self_efficacy$score ~ math_self_efficacy$confidence_rating_mean,
     col = &quot;steelblue3&quot;, # specify the color
     pch = 16, # choose a plotting symbol, options are 1, 2, ..., 25.
     xlab = &quot;Mean Confidence Rating for Each Student&quot;,
     ylab = &quot;Exam Score of Each Student (Out of 100 Pts.)&quot;,
     main = &quot;Study on Student Exam Performance in Math 101&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Options for Plotting Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you were curious, here are the <code>pch =</code> options you can pick from by selecting the number corresponding to the symbol you want.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each point in the plot represents both the confidence and score of one student. The points are plotted on the X-Y coordinate plane. The position on the horizontal (X) axis represents the student’s confidence rating. The height of the point or the value on the Y-axis, represents the student’s score on the exam.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The cloud of data illustrated in this scatterplot help us visualize the relationship between the student’s confidence rating and their score on the exam. Notice that the points tend to be higher as you move to the right. Students who have a high confidence rating (points further to the right) tend to have higher exam scores (higher vertical position). Similarly, students with lower confidence typically have lower exam scores. Notice that as a students’ confidence increases, their exam score tends to increase. We call this a <em>positive association</em> or a <em>positive correlation</em>.</p>
<p>Notice that there is variability in the responses. Consider how the plot below emphasizes the many different exam scores students could earn even for students who all have a mean confidence rating of 5.0. While there is technically only one student in the data set that had a confidence score of exactly 5 (and they scored a 93.3 on the exam) we can picture in our mind’s eye that if other Math 101 students were to also to report a confidence rating of 5, then we would see variability in their exam scores. In fact, in looking at the graph, we would expect students with a confidence rating of 5 to score from anywhere as low as a 60 on the exam to as high as a 100! That is quite a range of possibilities. So while knowing the confidence score of a student doesn’t tell us their exact exam score, it can give us a general idea about how such a student would score on the exam. For example, if a student had a confidence rating of 3.0, then we would expect them to score anywhere between a 34 and a 79 on the exam, which is a lower range of possibilities than we would expect for the student with a confidence rating of 5.0.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>When the points in a scatterplot follow a straight pattern, we say that there is a <em>linear relationship</em> in the data. Data are considered linearly related if the points in the scatterplot follow a straight line. The points do not have to be aligned tightly to represent a linear relationship. Both broadly scattered and narrow clouds of data can be considered linear. Here are some examples that all would be considered linear relationships.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson21_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In the examples above, even though each plot could be considered a <em>linear relationship</em>, they each differ in how much the dots are spread out along that linear relationship. We need to be able to describe the not only the <strong>shape</strong> of the relationship, but also the the <strong>direction</strong> and <strong>strength</strong> of a linear relationship in bivariate data. We use the correlation coefficient to quantify the direction and strength of the relationship. This idea is discussed below.</p>
</div>
<div id="describing-direction-scatterplots-and-the-correlation-coefficient" class="section level3">
<h3>Describing Direction: Scatterplots and the Correlation Coefficient</h3>
<p>We say that the direction of data in a scatterplot is <strong>positive</strong> or there is a <strong>positive association</strong> between two variables when an <em>increase</em> in one variable tends to lead to an <em>increase</em> in the other variable. We observed a positive association in Goodwin’s confidence data.</p>
<p>The <strong>correlation coefficient</strong> is a number that is used to measure the direction and strength of the linear association between two variables. The direction is either positive, negative, or neither. The strength can be described as weak, moderate, or strong.</p>
<p>Correlation coefficients are always between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. A correlation of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> implies <em>no correlation</em> in the data. We use the letter <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to represent the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>We will use software to compute the correlation coefficient. For the Goodwin data, the correlation coefficient is: <span class="math display">\[r = 0.728\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="r-instructions-for-computing-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>R Instructions for Computing Correlation</h3>
<div class="SoftwareHeading">
R Instructions
</div>
<div class="Software">
<p><strong>To compute correlation in R</strong> use the <code>cor(...)</code> function where the x-axis variable is listed first, followed by a comma <code>,</code>, followed by the y-axis variable second. The <code>cor(...)</code> function also requires stating the name of the data set and using the <code>$</code> sign to access the desired columns of the dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor(math_self_efficacy$confidence_rating_mean, math_self_efficacy$score)</code></pre>

<p>When a positive association exists in the data, the correlation coefficient <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> will be positive. As an example, a positive association was observed in Goodwin’s data and <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.728 &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many examples of positive associations. It has been demonstrated that a student’s level of motivation is positively associated with academic success <!--<cite>Busato00</cite>-->. Students who are highly motivated tend to do better academically. As another example, there is a positive association between the height of a person and their weight. If someone’s height increases, we would expect that their weight would typically be greater as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when an <em>increase</em> in one variable is associated with a <em>decrease</em> in the other variable, we say that there is a <strong>negative</strong> association between the two variables. Several studies have demonstrated that there is a negative association between the amount of time spent playing video games and academic performance<!--<cite>Gentile04</cite>-->. Students who spend a lot of time on video games tend to do worse in school than their peers who do not spend much time gaming.</p>
<div id="describing-strength-the-correlation-coefficient" class="section level4">
<h4>Describing Strength: The Correlation Coefficient</h4>
<p>We also describe the relationship between two variables as <strong>weak</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, or <strong>strong</strong>, depending on how close the relationship between the variables is. The strength of the linear relationship is also described in the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>The correlation coefficient <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is always a value between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. If there is a strong positive association, the correlation coefficient will be close to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. If the correlation coefficient is positive but relatively small, we say there is a weak positive association in the data. If the correlation is zero (or really close to zero), then we say there is no correlation in the data.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the correlation coefficient is close to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, we say there is a strong negative association. A weak negative association results in a correlation coefficient that is negative but close to 0. But if the correlation is negative and really close to zero, then we say there is no correlation in the data.</p>
<p>It is difficult to establish definite cut-off values to determine when a correlation goes from being weak to moderate or from moderate to strong. This depends a great deal upon the context of the data and how much is known about the situation already. In some contexts, a correlation of <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.2\)</span> could be considered strong. But typically in this class, we only consider correlations above <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.7\)</span> to be strong correlations (and similary for <span class="math inline">\(r = -0.7\)</span> and below). In this course, we also typically call anything between <span class="math inline">\(r = -0.3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.3\)</span> a weak correlation. But again, in a different course or in a different type of research, these cut-offs could completely change as to what we consider to be a <em>strong</em> or <em>weak</em> or <em>moderate</em> correlation.</p>
<p>Several scatterplots have been created, and the correlation coefficient summarizing the relationship between the two variables is presented. Study these graphs to see if you can infer some of the properties of the correlation coefficient.</p>

</div>
<p>A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts a mixture of hot water and steam. Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park is the world’s most famous geyser. This geyser earned its name from the predictability of the waiting time between its eruptions. At the Old Faithful Visitors Center, there is a sign predicting when the next eruption will occur. Rangers observing the behavior of the geyser maintain this sign for the convenience of park visitors.</p>
<p>The amount of time between eruptions (wait time) is random. However, it can be predicted, give-or-take a reasonable error bound.</p>
<div style="clear:both;">

</div>
<p><img src = "Images/Step2.png"></p>
<p>Researchers observed 272 eruptions of this geyser <!--<cite>Azzalini90</cite>-->. The researchers recorded the duration of each eruption (in minutes) and the waiting time until the next eruption (in minutes.) The data are given in the file <a href="./data/old_faithful">old_faithful</a>.</p>

<div class="Questions">
<ol start="13" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conduct the analysis you proposed in Question 1. What is your prediction for the waiting time between eruptions?</li>

<div id="Q13" style="display:none;">
<ul>
<li>The mean waiting times for the <span class="math inline">\(n = 272\)</span> observations in the data set is <span class="math inline">\(\bar x = 70.9\)</span> minutes. A 95% confidence interval for the true mean waiting time is: <span class="math inline">\((69.3,72.5)\)</span> minutes. We are 95% confident the true mean waiting time between eruptions is between <span class="math inline">\(69.3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(72.5\)</span> minutes. This is a true statement, but does it provide a good prediction? To assess this, we create a histogram of the waiting times:
<center>
<img src = "Images/OldFaithfulHistogram.png">
</center></li>
<li>Since this distribution is bimodal, the mean of the waiting times does not provide the most useful prediction tool.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="14" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How would you describe the shape of the distribution of the waiting times?</li>

<a href = "javascript:showhide('Q14')"><span style="font-size:8pt;">Show/Hide Solution</span></a>
<div id="Q14" style="display:none;">
<ul>
<li>The shape of the distribution is bimodal. This can be seen in the histogram computed as part of the solution to question 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>There appear to be two peaks in the histogram representing the waiting times. This bimodal distribution is curious. Why should there be a bimodal distribution in the duration of the eruptions? Could there be a relationship between the length of an eruption and the waiting time until the next eruption?</p>
<p>This can be explored using a scatterplot.</p>
<p>For the Old Faithful data, we plot the eruption duration on the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>-axis and the waiting time before the next eruption on the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>-axis of a scatterplot.</p>
<p><img src = "Images/OldFaithfulEruptions-Scatterplot-Excel.png"></p>
<p>Each point in the plot represents both the actual eruption time and the wait time until the next eruption of Old Faithful. The position of the point on the horizontal (X) axis represents the duration of the eruption, and the height of the point on the vertical (Y) axis represents the wait time for the next eruption. This helps us to visualize the relationship between the wait time and the duration of the eruption. Notice that when the wait time increases, so does the eruption duration.</p>

<ul>
<li>70.9 minutes is right in the middle of the two groups of data, so it might be a good “average”, but it looks like it is very rare for the waiting time to actually be 70.9 minutes.</li>

<!-- ## Covariance -->
<!-- The English idiom, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" counsels you to avoid investing all your time or money in one thing.  It is better to spread your resources across many opportunities to avoid losing everything.  This advice is very appropriate in the financial markets. -->
<!-- When considering a portfolio of stocks and bonds, it is wise to diversify the investments.  If one company or one sector of the economy declines, a diversified portfolio involving many different stocks and bonds can help minimize losses.  It is important for investors to understand the risk associated with a particular portfolio.  We can use the variability of the investments as a measure of the risk of a portfolio.   -->
<!-- In a financial market, investments do not act independently; they vary together.  For example, if the value of Apple Computers' stock drops, Microsoft's stock is also likely to decrease in value.  When making investment decisions, it is important to take into account the interrelationships among the investments.   -->
<!-- The **covariance** is a measure of how two variables (such as stock returns) vary together.  The covariance of two variables, $X$ and $Y$, is calculated by multiplying the following three items together: -->
<!-- - the correlation coefficient of $X$ and $Y$ -->
<!-- - the standard deviation of $X$, and -->
<!-- - the standard deviation of $Y$    -->
<!-- We compute the covariance for a data set using the formula: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- s_{xy} = r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- ### Example: Math Self Efficacy -->
<!-- As an example, we will compute the covariance for Goodwin's data.  The correlation coefficient was determined to be $r = 0.728$.  Using the file [math_self_efficacy.xlsx](./data/math_self_efficacy.xlsx), we compute the standard deviation of the mean confidence rating ($X$) to be $s_x = 0.939$ and the standard deviation of the test scores ($Y$) to be $s_y = 16.37$.  Applying the equation for the covariance of a collection of data, we get -->
<!-- $$  -->
<!-- s_{xy} = r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y = 0.728 \cdot 0.939 \cdot 16.37 = 11.19 -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- The covariance of $X$ and $Y$ will be positive if increasing values of $X$ correspond to increasing values of $Y$.  This is exactly what happened in Goodwin's data.  On the other hand, the covariance will be negative if an increase in $X$ tends to correspond with a decrease in $Y$.   -->
<!-- <div class = "QuestionsHeading">Answer the following question:</div> -->
<!-- <div class = "Questions"> -->
<!-- 17. Is it possible for the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ to be negative when the correlation coefficient is positive?  If so, how could this occur? -->
<!-- <a href = "javascript:showhide('Q17')"><span style = "font-size:8pt;">Show/Hide Solution</span></a> -->
<!-- <div id = "Q17" style = "display:none;"> -->
<!-- - It is impossible for the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ to be negative when the correlation coefficient is positive.  The covariance is the correlation coefficient multiplied by the standard deviations.  Since the standard deviation of any variable cannot be negative, the sign of the correlation coefficient will be the same as the sign of the covariance. -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- &nbsp; -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- If an investor wants to purchase two stocks, and they want to reduce their risk, they can choose two stocks with a negative covariance.  If the return on one stock decreases, the return on the other stock would tend to increase.  This diversification can help protect the investor when market conditions change. -->
<!-- ### Example: Microsoft Versus Apple -->
<!-- Suppose you are considering investing in two stocks.  The annual percent change in the price of Microsoft stock has a mean of 33.48% with a standard deviation of 49.31%.  For Apple, the mean is 42.03% and the standard deviation is 80.84%.  The correlation of these variables is 0.395.  Find the covariance of these two stocks. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- s_{xy} = r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y = 0.395 \cdot 49.31 \cdot 80.84 = 1574.56 -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- This number is difficult to interpret directly, but it gives an estimate of the joint variability in the prices of these stocks. -->
<!-- ### Sample Statistic and Population Parameter -->
<!-- The sample correlation coefficient, $r$, is an estimate of the unknown population correlation coefficient, $\rho$.  In a simiilar manner, we will consider the sample covariance and population covariance. -->
<!-- The sample covariance of the variables $X$ and $Y$ is denoted by the symbol $s_{xy}$.  Like all sample statistics, it is computed directly from specific data.  If we define the sample standard deviation of $X$ to be $s_x$ and the sample standard deviation of $Y$ to be $s_y$, then we can write the sample covariance of $X$ and $Y$ as: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- s_{xy} = r \cdot s_x \cdot s_y -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Using similar notation for the population standard deviation of the random variables $X$ and $Y$, we can write the population covariance as: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \sigma_{xy} = \rho \cdot \sigma_x \cdot \sigma_y -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- The sample statistic $s_{xy}$ is an estimator of the population parameter $\sigma_{xy}$.  We usually do not know the value of $\sigma_{xy}$.  Sometimes, we denote the population covariance as $Cov(X,Y)$ instead of $\sigma_{xy}$. -->
